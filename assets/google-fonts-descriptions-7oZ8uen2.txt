Zen Loop Family is one of three Latin fonts designed by Yoshimichi Ohira, as part of Zen Fonts collection.
</p>
<p>
Japanese kana characters contain many loops.

ZCOOL XiaoWei was contributed to the ZCOOL font project by designer Li Dawei and the team at Zuozi, who created the typeface as a gift for David’s daughter, “Little Fern”, on her third birthday.
It is intended to help fill the dearth of logo-ready Chinese display fonts.
The brush strokes are agile and recognizable, with spacing optimized to display at small or large sizes.
</p>
<p>
ZCool QingKe HuangYou was designed and produced by Zheng Qingke, and donated to the ZCOOL font project for public use.
It features innovative character shapes and rounded lines, with right angles adjusted to a rounded 4pt corner radius.
The lower right corner of the radicals are notched at a 45 degree angle, which raises the visual center of the font, effectively solving readability issues due to stroke crossing.
</p>
<p>
ZCool Kuaile was created by a team of font design trainees under the leadership of typographer Liu Bingke.
First, Liu created the character shape framework and design standards;
then, a group of over 100 typography apprentices participated in building out the character set.
Finally, Liu and other designers from his workshop, including Yang Kang and Wu Shaojie, edited and adjusted the characters to unify the design.

<p>
	The typeface offers exceptional adaptability through its variable font technology:
</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A weight axis ranging from ExtraLight to Black</li>
		<li>A width axis ranging from Condensed to Expanded</li>
		<li>Matching italics</li>
	</ul>

Its clean lines and modern aesthetic reflect Zalando's forward-thinking approach to fashion and lifestyle.

 Zain Group (zain.com) is a leading provider of innovative technologies and digital lifestyle communications operating 
 in eight markets across the Middle East and Africa. The objectives behind the Zain range of typefaces were to create a 
 unique modern range (8 weights: ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Italic, Bold, ExtraBold, Black and LightItalic ) that 
 supports Arabic and Latin languages as well as Urdu, Farsi, Kurdish, Indonesian and Tagalog. 
 It's suitable for headlines, sub-headings and body text, respecting Arabic calligraphy and cultural rules with maximum legibility. 
 A key design objective has been the harmony between the Latin and the Arabic and its suitability for all communications needs, 
 whether in print or on the web.

Intended for continuous reading on the web (longer articles in online news, magazines, blogs), Yrsa supports over 92
languages. A special consideration was given to Central and East European languages and proper shaping of their
accents.
A version that also supports 2 languages in the Gujarati script (Gujarati and Kachchi), is available as <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Rasa">Rasa</a>. In terms of glyphs included Rasa is a superset of
Yrsa and includes the complete Latin, but in Rasa the Latin may be adjusted to support the primary Gujarati font.
</p>
<p>
It is a deliberate experiment in remixing existing typefaces: 
The Latin part began with Eben Sorkin's <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather">Merriweather</a>.
The Gujarati began with David Březina’s <a href="https://www.rosettatype.com/Skolar#gujarati">Skolar Gujarati</a>.

A serif display type that is very feminine. 
I think that this is the only type in the world with such a feminine essence. 
Yeseva's name is from the phrase "Yes, Eva." As a sign of complete agreement between a man and a woman.
I dedicate this font to my beloved wife.

<p>&quot;Yanone Kaffeesatz&quot; was first published in 2004 and is Yanone&rsquo;s first ever finished typeface. Its
    Bold is
    reminiscent of 1920s coffee house typography, while the rather thin fonts bridge the gap to present times. Lacking
    self confidence and knowledge about the type scene, Yanone decided to publish the family for free under a <a
        href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/de/deed.en">Creative Commons License</a>. A decision that
    should turn out one of the best he ever made. It has been downloaded over 100,000 times to date, and you can witness
    Kaffeesatz use on German fresh-water gyms, Dubai mall promos and New Zealand McDonalds ads. And of course on coffee
    and foodstuff packaging and café design around the globe.</p>
<p>In 2009 he reworked much of the typeface and it got published in FontShop&rsquo;s <a
        href="http://www.fontfont.com/index.ep?aid=28">FontFont Library</a> under the new name <a
        href="http://www.yanone.de/typedesign/kava/">FF Kava</a>. You can read more about it in an extensive article by

Yaldevi is designed for display use, such as headlines, subheads, and short paragraphs, such as pull quotes. 
The almost neutral personality has a touch of whimsicality with the soft and smooth curves. 
The lighter weights are pleasingly beautiful and stylish, making it a delightful headline font. 
Slightly condensed shapes and dimensions make it possible to fit more text into single lines. 
The name means ‘Princes of Jaffna’ in Tamil and Sinhala, and is taken from the name of the intercity train in Sri Lanka that runs between Colombo and the Northern city of Jaffna. 
</p>
<p>
Yaldevi Colombo includes Sinhala and Latin glyphs, and some peculiar and experimental shapes that were invented to enhance the performance as a display typeface. 
Yaldevi Jaffna includes Tamil and Latin glyphs, and is designed with open counters and an overall friendly feel. 
Both are available in 6 weights, ExtraLight to ExtraBold, and can be used together in multilingual projects as they share the same vertical metrics.  
The Sinhala is designed by Denzil Rajitha, the Tamil by Pathum Egodawatta and Kosala Senevirathne, and the Latin by Sol Matas.

  Yaldevi is a narrow font intended for titles and short texts in the web supporing Latin and Sinhala scripts.
</p>
<p>
  Condensed shapes and dimensions make it possible to fit more text in a line. The x-height of Latin and body height of Sinhala is generous, and has short ascenders and descenders, increasing the space efficiency.
  It has a somewhat neutral personality with a touch of soft and smooth curves that add some whimsy.
  Yaldevi will perform well when used in headlines, subheads and shorter text blocks such as pull quotes.
  Sinhala glyphs have some peculiarities and experimental shapes that were invented to perform well as a display face while belonging in the formal text typeface category. Make sure you check out all these features before using it.

Work Sans is a typeface family based loosely on early Grotesques, such as those by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/14444337254/">Stephenson Blake</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/printingtypespec00millrich#page/226/mode/2up/">Miller &amp; Richard</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/stream/hauptprobeingedr00baue#page/109/mode/1up">Bauerschen Giesserei</a>. 
The Regular weight and others in the middle of the family are optimised for on-screen text usage at medium-sizes (14px-48px) and can also be used in print design.
The fonts closer to the extreme weights are designed more for display use both on the web and in print.
Overall, features are simplified and optimised for screen resolutions; for example, diacritic marks are larger than how they would be in print.
A version optimised for desktop applications is available from the Work Sans github project page.

<b>Updated August 2015:</b> All styles were updated to v1.40 to change the Thin (100) style to be the same as 'HairLine' in previous versions - even thinner! 
This avoids the complication of a second "Hairline" family. 
The ExtraLight (200) and Light (300) styles also changed accordingly.
Reflow will occur from previous versions on these weights.
</p>
<p>
<b>Updated February 2020:</b> Family has been upgraded to a variable font family.

<p>Workbench and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sixtyfour">Sixtyfour</a> fonts are inspired by the article Raster CRT Typography (According to DEC) by Norbert Landsteiner. They are a rework of some old pixel versions of the Commodore 64 and Amiga Workbench fonts the author created years ago.</p> 

<p>The fonts now include two custom axes: <i>Scanlines</i>, which allows control of the height of the lines and, as a result of this, the amount of vertical space between the lines. And <i>Bleed</i> to change the amount of horizontal bleed of the pixels due to the phosphor latency found in CRT displays.</p>

<p>Due to this project's specificity and the fonts' historical origin, they only support a limited set of glyphs.</p>

<h4>Discover the Elegance of Wittgenstein Font</h4>

<img src="about1.png"/>
<hr />
<h4>Precision and Modernity in Every Stroke</h4>

<p>
Introducing Wittgenstein, a typeface that redefines serif typography with clarity and sophistication. Inspired by the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, who recognized that what can be said can be said clearly, this font embodies his ethos with its sharp, well-defined form.
</p>
<img src="about2.png"/>
<img src="about3.png"/>

<h4>Why Wittgenstein Stands Out</h4>

<p>
Clarity in Design: Each letter is meticulously crafted with clear, sharp serifs that are more than just decorative—they command attention.
</p>
<img src="about5.png"/>

<p>
Versatile Styles: Available in five weights, from Regular to Black, and in italics, Wittgenstein adapts to any project. Its variable fonts with weight axis provide flexibility for diverse design needs.
</p>
<img src="about6.png"/>

<p>
Historical Elegance: This modern interpretation of Georg Trump's Mediaeval Old Style font and Walter Diethelm's Antiqua from the 1950s offers a broad-nib touch with contemporary flair.
</p>
<img src="about7.png"/>

<p>
Exceptional Readability: Ideal for high-volume texts and bold headlines, Wittgenstein ensures high readability and clarity, whether on digital screens or printed materials.

    Its modular-based characters are flavored with a sense of art nouveau. Nearly hairline thickness suggests usage for
    body text above 12px. While at display sizes it reveals its tiny dot terminals to create a sharp mood in headlines.

    Winky Sans looks like the sober, grown-up cousin of Comic Sans. Informal and personable, but not silly.</p>
<p>
    Based on Aniva Sans, the letter shapes are rounded and thickened at the endings, and little irregularities were added, wich results in the impression of handwriting.
</p>
<p>
    Winky Sans is a variable font with a weight axis that ranges from Light (300) to Black (900). But be careful! Like flowing ink on paper the forms grows in all directions.
    While the slim weights might have been written with a fineliner, the black style look like ink blots from a broken pen.
</p>
<p>
    The Rough styles imitate dried ink on rough paper.

<p>Wendy is loosely inspired by the STABILO logotype, a brand that works as a
conceptual and aesthetic reference. It evokes in me design values, form and
style.</p>

<p>The challenge was take a logotype consisting of seven letters as a starting
point to develop an alphabet. I liked the idea of the original logo for the
beauty of its forms: original and risky. I liked to continue the work of
someone whose development was arrested at another time, to animate these
characters, giving them new life through the design of a typeface that finds
the balance between the old and new forms. </p>

<p>The font was developed by Alejandro Inler in conjunction with Julieta
Ulanovsky.</p><p><strong>Foundry: <a href="http://www.sorkintype.com">Sorkin Type Co</a></strong></p>

<p>Wallpoet is inspired by the often political, short, sometimes provocative, sometimes funny or both, messages found on city walls, sprayed by some anonymous agent. Words, images or both!</p> <p>The idea behind the font is making a font with a bit of punch, but still easy to use for template graffiti. Print, cut & spray - being the key concept. That's why it has no curves and off course is a stencil font.</p> <p>With the font, Lars wants to pay respect to the urban guerilla scene, which has inspired him so often with it's total disrespect for the traditional and ingenious ability to break out of the traditional box.</p><p>Waiting for the Sunrise is based on the handwriting of a high school student. The title comes from the song <a href="http://theafters.com/music/">Lift Me Up by The Afters</a>. Although this font was created during a time of darkness in my life, it is a cheery, perky font.

<p>This font was created from the glyphs of the DEC VT320 text terminal, which I used in college, and for which I have retained an unaccountable nostalgia.</p> <p>I used a variety of tools, including Gimp, Python/PIL, and of course, FontForge.  The VT320 glyphs were designed with a nonrectangular pixel aspect ratio to fit the way the terminal scanned the CRT, so for this VT323 variation I had Python munge the locations and attempt to emulate the way the electron beam actually illuminated the phosphor and smeared the pixels horizontally on the terminal's CRT, so it looks more like what the actual glyph looked like on the screen. Python then drew the proper pixels into a 1:1 pixel grid as a monochrome PNG, which FontForge autoscanned into outlines.  I have attempted to support most of the glyphs available on the VT320, but that is a limited set to begin with, so please don't be disappointed that I haven't supported Esperanto or Riograndenser Hunsrückisch or whatever.</p> <p>There is another earlier variation called "VT321" that uses a more standard 1:1 pixel drawing technique, if you want to grab that as well.  I personally like VT323 better, and actually use it as my terminal font when cruising on the command line.</p><p>

<p>Vollkorn came into being as my first type designing attempt. I published the Regular in 2005 under a Creative-Commons-License. Until the counter finally collapsed two years later it had been downloaded thousands of times and used for web and print matters. It intends to be a quiet, modest and well working text face for bread and butter use. Unlike its examples in the book faces from the renaissance until today, it has dark and meaty serifs and a bouncing and healthy look. It might be used as body type as well as for headlines or titles. »Vollkorn« (pronounced »Follkorn«) is German for »wholemeal« which refers to the old term »Brotschrift«. It stood for the small fonts for every day use in hand setting times.</p>

<p>Volkhov is a low-contrast seriffed typeface with a robust character, intended for providing a motivating reading experience.</p> <p>As a four-weight family it is well-suited for complex text environments being economic and legible, contemporary and prominent. Many of its design solutions relate to this purpose: large open counters, rather short descenders, and brutal asymmetric serifs.</p> <p>Spacing in Bold is slightly increased compared to the normal weight, because the bold mass is mostly grown inwards. The Italic has a steep angle and a distinctive calligraphically reminiscent character, as a counterpart to the rigorous Regular.</p> <p>Designed by Ivan Petrov.</p><p>
Voces is a new graphic solution for the glyphs of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), considering the specific use-case of bilingual dictionaries. 
For this purpose, the typeface was conceived as a sans serif with gradual strokes, generous counterforms, a large "x" height, and short ascenders and descenders. 
These features attempt to solve the problems of spatial economy and print fidelity that dictionary typesetting presents. 
Ink traps were applied with consideration for the aesthetic and functional requirements. 
Voces was selected for exhibition in Tipos Latinos 2010.

Voces is designed by Ana Paula Megda and Pablo Ugerman.

It changes its mood as the context of use changes: it can be playful in a
childish design, feel punk in musical posters, unceremonious in fashion
magazines or aggressive in a warning poster.</p>

<p>The inspiration for this typeface comes from hand-made signs seen on the
street, and also the lettering found in musical culture. All shapes, lines and
corners look like they are improvised, yet each of them has common rules to
make the whole typeface work together, in both short words and longer
sentences.</p>

<p>The typeface was designed by Sergey Steblina, and the font was technically
engineered and published by Jovanny Lemonad.</p><p>Uncial Antiqua is a hybrid typeface which combines the speedier penned styles of Uncial and Half Uncial letterforms together in a formal text representation. Signature letterforms to the Uncial & Half Uncial styles are not sacrificed in this compilation, yet readability is surprisingly maintained when read in context.</p><p>

Trirong means &#8220;tricolor flag&#8221; in Thai, and represents the flag of Thailand.
A serif Latin and looped Thai typeface, it is characterized by thick and thin strokes, and its narrow and tall structure echoes that of traditional Thai typefaces. 
It saves space while preserving readability and legibility with its oval-shape looped terminal. 
This looped Thai and Transitional serif Latin works well in formal contexts. 
</p>
<p>
The similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, and ฎ and ฏ is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
Trirong takes a specific approach in how it deals with the thick and thin strokes in Thai glyphs. 
Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference.
Formal looped Thai typefaces have delicate details, so it is important for type designers to take care when extending them into heavy weights and avoid obscuring important details. 
The sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully too, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.
</p>

<p>Titillium is born inside the Accademia di Belle Arti di Urbino as a
didactic project Course Type design of the Master of Visual Design Campi
Visivi.</p>

<p>The aim of the project is the creation of a collective fonts released under
OFL. Each academic year, a dozen students work on the project, developing it
further and solving problems. Any type designer interested in the amendment or
revision of Titillium is invited to co-operate with us, or develop their own
variants of the typeface according to the terms specified in the Open Font
license. We also ask all graphic designers who use Titillium in their projects
to <a href="mailto:segreteria@accademiadiurbino.it">email us some examples</a>
of the typeface family in use, in order to prepare a case histories
database.</p>

    Tiro Telugu has its origins in a typeface designed for the Murty Classical Library of India book series, so is especially suited to traditional literary publishing but also made with the needs of today’s multiple print and screen media in mind. The design
    combines the proportions of Telugu manuscript tradition, notably in the generous proportions of subscript letters to aid legibility with the pronounced stroke modulation and shaping of counters and finials inspired by the elegant metal types of the
    Swatantra Type Foundry. Tiro Telugu uses extensive contextual layout behaviour to support arbitrary conjuncts, making it suitable for Sanskrit and Pali as well as Telugu language texts. For the Open Font License release, Tiro Telugu has been extended
    to support additional characters, and features a new italic companion. Each font also includes a Latin subset including diacritics for transcription of Indian languages.
</p>
<p>
    Tiro Telugu was designed by John Hudson and Fiona Ross. The italic was adapted by Kaja Słojewska.

    Tiro Tamil has its origins in a typeface designed for the Murty Classical Library of India book series, so is especially suited to traditional literary publishing but also made with the needs of today’s multiple print and screen media in mind. The design
    takes inspiration from Tamil metal types developed in Madras (Chennai) in the 19th and early 20th Century, which were influenced by both traditional palm leaf manuscripts and contemporary writing. The stroke modulation makes for a dynamic design for
    modern typography, while traditional forms of ligatures are accessible via OpenType Layout features. For the Open Font License release, Tiro Tamil has been extended to support additional characters, and features a new italic companion suitable for
    traditional slanted Tamil typography. Each font also includes a Latin subset including diacritics for transcription of Indian languages.

    Tiro Kannada has its origins in a typeface designed for the Murty Classical Library of India book series, so is especially suited to traditional literary publishing but also made with the needs of today’s multiple print and screen media in mind. The design
    takes inspiration from several sources: the crisp, open counters of the 19th Century types of the renowned Basel Mission Press; the styling of ligatures in types of the Gujarat Type Foundry from the 1930s; and the dynamic stroke angles of unattributed
    types found in a 20th Century Kannada textbook. Tiro Kannada features generously proportioned subscript letters for enhanced legibility. For the Open Font License release, Tiro Kannada has been extended to support additional characters, and features

    also something fresh in the context of modern typography. For the Open Font License release, Tiro Gurmukhi has been extended to support additional characters, and features a new italic companion. Each font also includes a Latin subset including diacritics

tiny5 is a variable-width, 5-pixel font playing with the concept of least amount of information while producing both legible and aesthetically pleasing text.
</p>
<p>
It is inspired by the graphing calculators and digital gadgets of the 1980s-90s, where the constraints of limited pixel space demanded efficient and minimalist design. It can be used for invoking a retro or nostalgic feel, for conveying the idea of minimalism, or for efficiently presenting information on small displays.
</p>
<p>
tiny5 supports the Google Fonts Latin Kernel, Latin Core, Latin Plus, Latin African, Greek Core, Cyrillic Core and Cyrillic Plus character set.

    Tilt is a family of type inspired by the dimensional lettering found in storefront signage.
    It’s comprised of three related variable font styles that you might find in a shop window — 
    <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tilt+Neon">Tilt Neon</a>, 
    <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tilt+Prism">Tilt Prism</a>,
    and Tilt Warp.
</p>
<p>
    All three are based around the same letter model of a sign painter’s geometric sans serif,
    similar to the typefaces Futura or Avant Garde, but with the kinds of details you might expect to see
    when the letter is built up with a brush.
</p>
<p>
    The three styles are designed and built as variable fonts.
    They allow users to rotate the orientation of their glyphs with “Rotation in X” and
    “Rotation in Y” axes. The rotation is limited to ±45° so that the letterforms never rotate past a readable
    range.

Tillana is a refreshingly informal family of typefaces for Devanagari and Latin.
The fonts were first published by the Indian Type Foundry as an open source project in 2014.
Coming in at 1,021 glyphs per weight, Tillana has all of the characters necessary to set a variety of European languages, as well as Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, and more.
The Tillana family includes five styles, which range in weight from Regular through Extra Bold.
Tillana’s Latin do not connect; this part of the family is a non-joining script type.
The Devanagari part is one of the few “true cursive” designs currently available for the script.
</p>

<p>
Characters from both writing systems appear as if they were fluidly handwritten, particularly the Devanagari.
Tillana’s letterforms are slanted at a 10 degree angle.
The strokes are show visible contrast, and the dynamic counter forms are one of the design’s most prominent features.
The forms involve many loops and hooks and most of the knots are loops rather than closed, black forms.
All vertical strokes in both scripts have swelling at their tops and bottoms, and the Devanagari characters’ central vertical strokes almost always break through the headline.
Handwriting artefacts are present in the Latin letters, too, such as hook on the descender of the lowercase q.
</p>

<p>
Tillana’s Devanagari base character height falls vertically between the Latin upper and lowercase letter heights.
The Latin characters have a small x-height and long ascenders and descenders.
Lipi Raval designed the Devanagari components of Tillana, and worked together with Jonny Pinhorn on the Latin.
</p>

This project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type foundry based in Ahmedabad, Gujurat, India, who design contemporary Indian typeface families.

This font family has been created for use in headlines and other display-sized text on screen. Five font styles make up the initial release.</p>

<p>Display families with extensive character sets are rare for any script. With Indian typefaces, however, large character sets are even less common. ITF’s designs are an exception. The Teko typeface features letterforms with low stroke contrast, square proportions and a structure that appears visually simple.</p>

<p>The Regular, Medium and Semibold fonts are recommended for use in long headlines, while Bold is intended primarily for setting just one or two words. The Light is a beautiful variant that may be put to exceptionally good use in large headlines on websites. At display sizes, Teko works equally well on screen or in print. Each font contains 1090 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written with the Devanagari script. Teko is an excellent choice for use in advertising or for news tickers on television screens (breaking news, etc.)</p>

Taviraj is a serif Latin and looped Thai typeface that has a wide structure that ensures readability and legibility. 
It is well-suited for formal usage. 
Thai letters have thick and thin strokes, similar to the Latin, together with rounded and airy looped terminals. 
Taviraj is a 9 weight family that includes italics. 
</p>
<p>
Taviraj is a Thai word that refers to the last two kings of Krungsri Ayutthaya, the former capital of Thailand. 
People also metaphorically refer to Taviraj as the fall of a dynasty, and that is the reason why it appeared in the poem written by King Rama V regarding the situation of Siam being threatened by French expansionism, with his majesty expressing his sorrow towards the possibility of the end of his era. 
A traditional Thai style of typeface is called &#8220;farangses,&#8221; which means french, and Taviraj is in this genre. This contradiction highlights its origin. 
</p>
<p>
A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ and ฎ ฏ is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
Taviraj takes a specific approach when dealing with the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. 
Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. 
Formal looped Thai typefaces have delicate details so care must be taken when expanding them to heavier weights, to retain all the details.
The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks has been managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.
</p>
<p>

<p>Tauri is a semi condensed sans typeface with a sense of restraint, clarity

spaced.</p>

<p>TASA Orbiter is part of the TASA Typeface Collection—two typefaces originally commissioned by the <a href="https://www.tasa.org.tw/en-US">Taiwan Space Agency (TASA)</a> as part of its institutional rebrand, and released under the SIL Open Font License. It is accompanied by its sibling typeface, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/TASA+Explorer">TASA Explorer</a>.</p>

<p>TASA Orbiter is a neo-grotesque sans-serif that reflects the technical precision of space operations. Built from a systematic vocabulary of recurring forms, it features slightly squared counters and right-angled turns, reinforcing its mechanical tone.</p>

<p>The original TASA typefaces (v1) were designed by Local Remote between 2022 and 2023. TASA Orbiter (v1) was released in 13 styles across three optical sizes: Text and Deck each had four weights, while Display included five weights.</p>

<p>In 2025, both typefaces were updated by Weizhong Zhang with a focus on preserving their core design characteristics while enhancing drawing precision and readability. TASA Orbiter (v2) consolidated its optical size variants, reducing the total styles from 13 to five weights—streamlining the family in line with TASA Explorer. The new design is based on the former “Deck” optical size, with refined forms and spacing optimized for flexible use. The fonts now support the Google Fonts Core Latin character set, along with additional glyphs for Taiwanese Romanizations (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A2i-u%C3%A2n_L%C3%B4-m%C3%A1-j%C4%AB_Phing-im_Hong-%C3%A0n">Tâi-lô</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB">POJ</a>).</p>

<p>TASA Explorer is a geometric sans-serif designed to embody the adventurous spirit of space exploration. Its vertically cut terminals and sharp-angled corners lend a bold, assertive presence that commands attention. Subtle contrast between thick and thin strokes introduces visual rhythm, preventing the geometric structure from feeling static or rigid.</p>

<p>The original TASA typefaces (v1) were designed by Local Remote between 2022 and 2023. TASA Explorer (v1) featured five weights and was designed exclusively for display use. With an extremely large x-height and minimal optical corrections, it was optimized for high-impact performance at large sizes.</p>

<p>In 2025, both typefaces were updated by Weizhong Zhang. The focus of the update was to preserve their core design characteristics while improving drawing precision and readability. TASA Explorer (v2) introduces a slightly reduced x-height, smoother letterforms, and more relaxed spacing, resulting in a more even texture across text blocks. It is now suitable for both display and text applications. The fonts now support the Google Fonts Core Latin character set, along with additional glyphs for Taiwanese Romanizations (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A2i-u%C3%A2n_L%C3%B4-m%C3%A1-j%C4%AB_Phing-im_Hong-%C3%A0n">Tâi-lô</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB">POJ</a>).</p>

Sumana is a family of Latin and Devanagari fonts for text setting and web usage. 
Designed by Alexei Vanyashin in 2014-2015 for Cyreal.
</p>

<p>
The Latin counterpart is derived from Lora by Olga Karpushina, Cyreal. 
Its vertical and horizontal metrics are adjusted to better match with the Devanagari. 
The meaning of Sumana in Sanskrit is flower, which is the meaning of Lora in Spanish. 
It was quite a challenge to match the graphical characteristics of each script and took many iterations to finalise the first release. 
I tried to keep the Devanagari closer to a traditional Indian calligraphic model while flavouring it with graphic solutions derived from Lora's Latin. 
</p>

<p>
It is my first attempt to design a Devanagari, and I am thankful to Google Fonts for making this project happen, and to all experts who consulted with me on this project, including:

<p>It was drawn at an angle that places reverse emphasis on strokes, giving it a non-traditional weight balance, while also upholding the characteristics that make each letterform recognizable.</p>

<p>Tension and balance are central themes, combining the imperfection of handwriting and the precision of printed letters. Individuality is met with consistency. Unlike qualities are brought together in a harmony that makes for a unique typographic expression.</p>

<p>With over 700 glyphs, the typeface supports 25 Latin languages and includes two sets of stylistic alternates that offer more variation.</p>

<p>Stoke is a semi-wide high contrast serifed text typeface. Stoke is inspired by letters found on 20th century UK posters showing an odd combination of seriousness of form and whimsical proportions and details. Stoke's low x height make it most suitable for use at medium to large sizes.</p>
<p>Stoke is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts. More specifically, this release supports the following Unicode ranges: Latin-1, Latin-2: Eastern Europe, Turkish, Macintosh Character Set.</p>
<p>Stoke was updated in July 2012 with a slightly darker regular weight to allow <a href="http://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint">ttfautohint</a> to create high quality hinting for Windows. The optimization of the design for screen rendering involved changes to glyph sizes, letter spacing, and serif where bends were reduced to solve rendering problem in Windows XP. The character set was also expanded.</p>

<p>In geometry, a spirax is a curved line starting from a central point and
moving progressively away and around that point. The Spirax font is inspired
in this concept, trying to make you feel that you can go away from your
starting point but you’ll never be foreign. Spirax has a pronounced contrast
and original curves. It can be used for headlines and shorter texts. Spirax is
cute at all sizes!</p>

<h4>Screen-first typefaces</h4>
<p>The history of early digital typefaces, though still fairly recent, has already proven that typeface design doesn’t need to reinvent itself because of technical constraints. One only has to look back over the last 20 years to discover work that forged a viable path. Many early digital types (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinit%C3%A9_(typeface)">Trinité</a>, <a href="http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/demos-next/">Demos</a>, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wdYmvQD5C8IC&pg=PT99#v=onepage&q&f=false">Colorado</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(typeface)">Georgia</a> for example) set a powerful example by being unobtrusive, transparent designs that rely on commonly accepted shapes, while remaining innovative and fit-for-purpose. These giants, on whose shoulders Spectral aspires to stand, form a solid set of accomplished, serious designs.</p>

<h3>Introducing <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono?query=space+mono">Space Mono</a> a monospaced typeface by Colophon Foundry for <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>.</h3>
<p>As designers of type, we most often find ourselves composing a monospaced (sometimes called a fixed-width, fixed-pitch, or non-proportional) typeface in the service of building out the styles of an accompanying proportional type family or type system. It’s about adapting the proportional type’s forms and rules, and discovering how those letterforms behave within fixed limits to give the face new texture and capability. But what if that constraint was embraced? What if we set out to create a monospaced typeface that wasn’t simply an extension, but rather something unto itself?</p>

Source Serif 4 is a serif typeface in the transitional style, designed to complement the <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Sans+3">Source Sans 3</a> family.
The close companionship of Serif and Sans is achieved by a careful match of letter proportions and typographic color.
Source Serif is loosely based on the work of Pierre Simon Fournier, and many idiosyncrasies typical to Fournier’s designs (like the bottom serif on the b or the middle serif on the w) are also found in Source Serif.
Without being a pure historical revival, Source Serif takes cues from Fournier and reworks them for a modern age.
</p>
<p>
Both typeface families have different personalities because they spring from the hands of different designers:
Source Serif was designed by Frank Grießhammer, Source Sans was designed by Paul Hunt.
Robert Slimbach consulted on both designs, which helped maintain the overall family harmony.
Either design feels confident on its own but also works in combination with the other — just like their designers do.
</p>
<p>
Source Serif continues <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts">Adobe’s line of high-quality open source typefaces</a>.
Designed for a digital environment, the letter shapes are simplified and highly readable.
Its historical roots, combined with expert guidance give the typeface a strong character of its own that will shine when used for extended text on paper or screen.
</p>
<p>
Source Serif is an active Open Source project – if you are interested in contributing, for more information please visit <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif-pro">github.com/adobe/source-serif-pro</a> 
</p>
<p>Source&#174; Sans Pro, Adobe's first open source typeface family, was designed by Paul D. Hunt. It is a sans serif typeface intended to work well in user interfaces.</p>

<p>To contribute, see <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans">github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans</a></p>
<p>Source Code was designed by Paul D. Hunt as a companion to Source Sans.This complementary family was adapted from the Source design due to a request to create a monospaced version for coding applications. Source Code preserves the design features and vertical proportions of Source Sans, but alters the glyph widths so that they are uniform across all glyphs and weights.</p>

<p>Although this family was designed specifically for coding environments, for which a regular weight will typically suffice, Source Code has been made available in the same weight range as the corresponding Source Sans design.Source Code Pro currently supports a wide range of languages using the Latin script, and includes all the characters in the Adobe Latin 4 glyph set.</p>

<p>As an open source project, it is expected that incremental updates will be made over time to extend glyph set coverage and functionality. In 2019, we have updated the family to <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/releases/tag/2.030R-ro%2F1.050R-it">Roman v2.030 and Italic v1.050</a>. This update now supports Greek, Cyrillic, Vietnamese and Italic styles.</p>

<p>A revival of Frederic Goudy's 'Goudy Oldstyle' with Regular and Italic styles, and extended Latin character coverage.</p><p>Sora, meaning sky in Japanese, is a typeface family commissioned for the <a href="https://sora.org/" target="_blank">Sora</a> decentralized autonomous economy focused on empowering projects that benefit society. Soramitsu, the developer of Sora, is a Japanese technology company specializing in blockchain development and well-known for creating the first central bank digital currency.</p>
<p>Sora typeface was designed to capture Soramitsu's spirit and heritage resulting in a type family with cues of low-resolution aesthetics and early screen typography but without nostalgia, as every decision was considered towards the crisp digital environment of today. The particularly big x-height combined with evidently generous counters turns the family into a convenient tool for app and web interfaces, where clarity and effectiveness at any size is an imperative.</p>

This font was developed by the <a href="https://documentingjudeospanish.com/">Documenting Judeo-Spanish Project</a>.
</p>
<p>
Documenting Judeo-Spanish is a digital humanities project that began in 2019 under the leadership of Dr. Bryan Kirschen. Recalling his initial fascination with Solitreo and the limited resources available to learn this script, Dr. Kirschen decided to focus this project on the cursive variety that was once common to speakers of Judeo-Spanish around the world. A nearly-extinct alphabet to an endangered language, this style of writing can be found in documents ranging from journal entries and ledgers to personal correspondence and community minutes. Many of these very documents are sitting in basements and attics today and, to the untrained eye, are mistaken for Hebrew.
</p>
<p>
Judeo-Spanish (Ladino) refers to the variety of Spanish that developed among Jewish populations who were expelled from Spain in 1492 and subsequently settled throughout Turkey and the Balkans, then of the Ottoman Empire. These Jews, known as Sephardim, preserved many features of Medieval (varieties of) Spanish, while incorporating linguistic elements from the languages spoken in their surroundings, including: Turkish, Greek, Serbo-Croatian, French, Italian, and Arabic. As a Jewish language, the Spanish of the Sephardim has always been in contact with Hebrew. And while Judeo-Spanish may sound like other Romance languages, in writing, it would have traditionally appeared more similar to a Semitic language.
</p>
<p>
Solitreo refers to the Hebrew-based cursive script once used by Sephardim; it is the cursive variety of the Rashi alphabet. Solitreo, or Soletreo, is derived from Galician/Portuguese, meaning ‘to spell.’ For many Sephardim, Solitreo was simply known as ganchos, meaning ‘hooks,’ due to the ligatures that form between letters. This style of writing is distinct from the Ashkenazi-based alphabet used for cursive Hebrew today, making documents in Solitreo undecipherable to the untrained eye. A similar style of writing can also be found in documents written in Judeo-Arabic. Today, Solitreo is a relic of the past, as most writers of the language utilize Roman characters.
</p>
<p>
Most non-Hebrew glyphs in this font were forked from <a href="https://github.com/itfoundry/kalam">Kalam</a>.

<h3>Homecomputer Fonts</h3>
<p>
  These fonts are inspired by the interface fonts of two classic 1980s
  computers, the Commodore C64 (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sixtyfour">Sixtyfour</a>) 
  and Amiga (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Workbench">Workbench</a>). 
  When Jens Kutilek adapted them to the variable font technology, 
  he did not just convert the pixel fonts, but tried to emulate the artifacts of 
  rendering letters on a CRT screen.
</p>
<p>
  The above fonts include two custom axes: <em>Scanlines</em>, which allows
  control of the height of the lines and, as a result of this, the amount of
  vertical space between the lines. And <em>Bleed</em> to change the amount of
  horizontal bleed of the pixels due to the phosphor latency found in CRT
  displays.
</p>
<img src="sixtyfour-2.png" />
<h4>Sixtyfour Convergence</h4>
<p>
  Sixtyfour Convergence is Simon Cozens's COLRv1 take on Sixtyfour, which introduces 
  two additional new custom axes:
  <em>Horizontal Element Alignment</em> and
  <em>Vertical Element Alignment</em>. These axes allow the control of the position 
  of three painted layers, reproducing the control of the offset positions of the 
  red, green, and blue colors common on CRT monitors.
</p>
<img src="sixtyfour-1.gif" />
<p>Sixtyfour and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Workbench">Workbench</a> fonts are inspired by the article Raster CRT Typography (According to DEC) by Norbert Landsteiner. They are a rework of some old pixel versions of the Commodore 64 and Amiga Workbench fonts the author created years ago.</p>

<p>The fonts now include two custom axes: <i>Scanlines</i>, which allows control of the height of the lines and, as a result of this, the amount of vertical space between the lines. And <i>Bleed</i> to change the amount of horizontal bleed of the pixels due to the phosphor latency found in CRT displays.</p>

Shrikhand supports the Gujarati and Latin writing systems. 
The name (શ્રીખંડ) is a sweet and creamy Gujarati dessert that is a particular favourite of the designer, Jonny Pinhorn.
</p>
<p>
In the three or four years prior to the initial development of this font in June 2015, Jonny lived in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, working for Indian Type Foundry. 
During this time India had a profound effect on his design philosophy and general worldview. 
Shrikhand is the culmination of three years absorbing the colourful and vibrant hand-painted lettering that can be seen on the streets in Gujarat. 
Big, bold, and unapologetic, Shrikhand is a display type that evolved from discussions with colleagues about how good the Gujarati script looks when it is free to be as curvaceous and expressive as possible.

Secular One is an original Hebrew and Latin humanistic sans serif typeface with a single weight.
At the time of publication (2016) there were not yet many Hebrew sans serif text typefaces. 
The designer Michal Sahar wanted to create a fresh, “easy going” design, simple but not neutral, friendly but not flattering or over-styled, straight but not too much… and highly readable in small sizes and long paragraphs. 
The Secular letterforms work equally well when used at large sizes where the delicate and eccentric elements are revealed, making it useful for branding purposes as well as typsetting long-form texts. 
</p>

<p>The June 2023 update features a bigger glyphset and some small fixes.</p>

The Secular project is led by Michal Sahar, a type designer based in Tel Aviv, Israel.

    <p>Display families with extensive character sets are rare for any script. With Indian typefaces, large character sets are often even less common. The Indian Type Foundry’s font families have been an exception, however. Sarpanch continues this trend. Sarpanch is an Open Source typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. It was designed for use in large point sizes and pixel sizes. Sarpanch’s letterforms are made up of strokes with a high contrast. They are also drawn with wide proportions, based on a squared construction principle.</p>

<p>Six fonts make up the Sarpanch family, ranging in weight from Regular to Black. As weight increases along the family’s axis, vertical strokes become thicker, but the typeface’s horizontals retain the same thickness across each weight. While the rather wide Regular weight of the family is almost monolinear, the Black weight appears to have a very high degree of contrast.</p>

<p>The Regular, Medium and Semibold fonts are recommended for use in short headlines, while Bold, Heavy and Black are intended primarily for setting single words or pairs. At display sizes, Sarpanch works equally well on screen or in print. Each font contains 1035 glyphs and offers full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written in the Devanagari script.</p>

<p>The Medium–Black weights of the Sarpanch family were design by Manushi Parikh at ITF in 2014. Jyotish Sonowal designed the Regular weight. Sarpanch is an excellent choice for use in advertising or for news tickers on television screens (breaking news, etc.) In Hindi, the word Sarpanch means ‘the head of a village’.</p>

<p>Russo means Russian. It seems strange that in a such font there is no snow,
vodka or bears. What I wanted to show is that Russian culture is quite varied
and modern. In Russia, too, some people love good fonts and typography.
Russo One is designed for headlines and logotypes. It is simple and original,
stylish and casual.</p><p>Russo One is a Unicode typeface family that supports
languages that use the Cyrillic, Baltic, Turkish, Central Europe, Latin script

The Ruslan Display font is based on a 1970s typeface made by Ukrainian designer Oleg Snarsky, which evokes the <em>ustav</em> and <em>semiustav</em> styles of the 11th–16th centuries, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruthenians">Ruthenian</a> period.
This is featured in the signage of Kiev's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teremky_(Kyiv_Metro)">Teremky</a> metro station, and in a collection of Snarsky's typefaces in the book “Шрифты-алфавиты для рекламных и декоративно-оформительских работ“ published in 1979 and <a href="https://my.etnoua.info/novyny/knyha-shryfty-alfavity-osnarskyj-1979/">available online</a>. 
</p>
<p>
It was digitized and extended with an original Latin complement by Russian designer Denis Masharov, in collaboration with Vladimir Rabdu, in 2011.
The name means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruslan_(given_name)">‘lion’</a>.
</p> 
Suitable for lettering, Ruslan Display can also be used to set short texts and supports Latin and Cyrillic.

<p>Rozha One is a very high contrast Open Source font, which currently offers support for the Devanagari and Latin scripts. Created primarily for display use, the extreme difference between its letters’ thick and thin strokes make it an excellent choice for large headlines and poster-sized graphics. The Indian Type Foundry released Rozha One in 2014; its Devanagari character set was designed by Tim Donaldson and Jyotish Sonowal. Shiva Nallaperumal designed the Latin.</p>

<p>The font’s Latin characters are drawn in a fat face ‘modern’ or ‘Didone’ style, similar to letters that were commonly used in 19th century advertising posters in the West. Rozha One’s Latin characters barely differentiate between upper and lowercase letter sizes; the x-height of its lowercase letters is so high – and the size of its capital letters so small – that these virtually blend into one another in a line of text. Nevertheless, the Devanagari letters are drawn in such a way that they harmonise with the font’s Latin very well in settings where texts in multiple languages sit alongside one another. The headline of the Devanagari base characters is the same thickness as the Latin letters’ serifs. Certain Devanagari letter strokes and vowel marks bare visually similarity to the font’s Latin letters. However, Rozha One does not appear Latinized or un-Devanagari.</p>

<p>The font includes 1,095 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written with the Devanagari script. When used in on-screen design environments, Rozha One should be used in very large pixel sizes. However in print, the design may be used in a broader range of sizes, perhaps even as small as at 16 or 18 points.</p>

<p>Rowdies is a Latin display typeface inspired by the rough &amp; tough Indian action cinema. Roughness and oddness of each individual letter contribute collectively as a typeface to the fantasy of being bold, fearless and strong.</p> 
<p>Designed by Jaikishan Patel for action, drama, adventure, thriller, noir &amp; crime genres of storytelling.</p>
<p>The font family includes 600+ glyphs in 3 weights; Light, Regular, and Bold.</p>

<p>Rouge Script is a formal script type, initiall drawn by hand with a copperplate nib and redrawn with the termination style of a brush script. This gives it the flavor of a casual script.</p> <p>It is very soft and has fast curves, while its low slant angle makes it very legible and improves the render on-screen. It works perfectly for titles or short phrases in branding, magazines, food, feminine and fashion related typography.</p><p>Rosarivo is a typeface designed for use in letterpress printing. It is an elegant and luxurious typeface with high quality details. It works especially well in delicate editorial design. Its letterpress origins mean it has a lighter color than a typical Roman text type. Its features include carefully designed serifs, gradual stroke and marked contrast, calligraphic and humanistic forms, and large ascenders and descenders. It is designed to work well in long texts with generous line spacing. It originates from work presented to the post-graduate course in Typeface Design at the University of Buenos Aires in 2011.</p> <p>Rosarivo is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts.

<p>Ropa Sans is an open-source subset of the Ropa Sans Pro family. Ropa Sans Pro consists of 8 weights plus extra designed italics and small caps, with extensive coverage of Latin and essential coverage of Cyrillic and Greek scripts, and is available commercially from <a href="http://lettersoup.de/">lettersoup.de</a>.</p>

<p>This Open Font License version, Ropa Sans, consists of the regular weight and the corresponding italic, and covers Latin-based languages only.</p>

<p>While the upright styles pay a distant homage to the technical aesthetics of the early-20th century DIN series, the strongly humanistic italics breathe in quirky freshness and create a unique flavour. The step to a remarkable Italic with its extreme ink-traps caused a hard change of nearly all shapes of the first slices of Roman.</p><p>The Romanesco typeface is a refined, semi-bold and narrow hand crafted calligraphic style.</p>

<p>With stabbing strokes that nod to historical styles, and modern flair leaning towards the current, Romanesco lends itself to a wide array of stylistic uses for a narrow typestyle.</p><p>
Rokkitt was initiated by Vernon Adams when he was inspired by the type forms of a number of distinctive geometric slab serifs, sometimes called Egyptians, popular in the late nineteenth and early to mid twentieth centuries.
In 1910 the Inland Type Foundry published Litho Antique and similar types were published by American Type Founders in the 1920s and Monotype Corporation in the 1930s.
Rokkitt is intended for use as a display font, in headings and headlines, though it can also be used as an alternative to sans serif designs at text sizes.
</p>
<p>
<b>Update January 2017:</b>
Vernon Adams began the project in 2011, and developed the typeface until 2014. 
During 2016 Kalapi Gajjar completed Vernon's original work and released a substantial update with a full set of 9 weights, and support for more Latin languages. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Update July 2019:</b>
The family has been converted into a variable font.
</p>
<p>
<b>Update January 2023:</b>

    Roboto Serif is a variable typeface family designed to create a comfortable and frictionless reading experience. Minimal and highly functional, it is useful anywhere (even for app interfaces) due to the extensive set of weights and widths across a broad
    range of optical sizes. While it was carefully crafted to work well in digital media, across the full scope of sizes and resolutions we have today, it is just as comfortable to read and work in print media.
</p>

Roboto Mono is a monospaced addition to the <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a> type family. 
Like the other members of the Roboto family, the fonts are optimized for readability on screens across a wide variety of devices and reading environments. 
While the monospaced version is related to its variable width cousin, it doesn&#8217;t hesitate to change forms to better fit the constraints of a monospaced environment. 
For example, narrow glyphs like &#8216;I&#8217;, &#8216;l&#8217; and &#8216;i&#8217; have added serifs for more even texture while wider glyphs are adjusted for weight. 
Curved caps like &#8216;C&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217; take on the straighter sides from Roboto Condensed.
</p>

<p>
Special consideration is given to glyphs important for reading and writing software source code. 
Letters with similar shapes are easy to tell apart. 
Digit &#8216;1&#8217;, lowercase &#8216;l&#8217; and capital &#8216;I&#8217; are easily differentiated as are zero and the letter &#8216;O&#8217;. 
Punctuation important for code has also been considered. 
For example, the curly braces &#8216;{&nbsp;}&#8217; have exaggerated points to clearly differentiate them from parenthesis &#8216;(&nbsp;)&#8217; and braces &#8216;[&nbsp;]&#8217;. 
Periods and commas are also exaggerated to identify them more quickly. 
The scale and weight of symbols commonly used as operators have also been optimized.

    Roboto Flex upgrades Roboto so it becomes a more powerful typeface system. With Flex, you can customize Roboto to express and finesse your text in ways never before possible. Today, people are constantly switching between devices, resizing browsers, and
    spreading our viewports across multiple screens. So Google commissioned Font Bureau to re-imagine Roboto to “flex” along with us, with a special emphasis on large-screen capabilities. This was achieved by amplifying the original design to an extreme
    range of weights, grades, widths and optical sizes.
</p>
<p>
    The second benefit of Roboto Flex is the designer’s ability to fitness and fine-tune their designs with <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/parametric_axes">parametric axes</a>. Font Bureau first demonstrated the concept of parametric
    axes in <a href="https://www.axis-praxis.org/specimens/amstelvar">Amstelvar Alpha</a> (2017), to provide the ultimate in typographic flexibility. With early prototypes of Roboto Flex, Font Bureau demonstrated new solutions to the typographic problems
    that digital designers face. Demonstrations of high quality justification, better dark-mode typography and other uses of parametric axes are documented at <a href="https://variablefonts.typenetwork.com">variablefonts.typenetwork.com</a>
</p>
<p>
    The needs of developers, designers, and — of course — end-user readers were prioritized and aligned during development. To make Roboto Flex production-ready for all print and digital media, Font Bureau expanded the glyph set with careful planning and
    development, in partnership with script experts for Cyrillic and Greek. Rigorous testing of each glyph across every axis required new type design tools to be developed, like <a href="https://typetools.typenetwork.com/">typetools</a> and <a href="https://videoproof.typenetwork.com/">videoproof</a>,
    which can be used to explore the depth of the design.
</p>
<p>
    The final file size of the complete package is remarkably small, given the range of expressive styles now available. By driving variable fonts technology to its limits, it offers the most interesting and useful typographic tools for end users and designers.
    With a fully loaded Optical Size axis, Roboto Flex makes the layout of texts with deep hierarchies more straightforward and heightens the quality of every design that uses it.
</p>

</p><p>Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.</p>

<p>This is the Condensed family, which can be used alongside the normal Roboto family and the Roboto Slab family.</p>

<p>In August 2023, the family has been upgraded to a variable font.</p>

<p>Risque finds its inspiration from the title screen of the 1962 Looney
Toons cartoon called "Martian through Georgia". Originally an all

retro and all-around offbeat occasions.</p>

Rhodium Libre was designed for use on screens at small sizes and the Latin and Devanagari scripts. 
To that end, the design is generally uncomplicated and coarse, lacking the small details that are lost on screens; this also reduces the file size to improve latency when used as a web font. 
The letters are designed slightly wide, with open counters, a large x-height in the Latin glyphs, and so on. 
The Devanagari glyphs are the same height as the Latin capitals to allow them to stand alongside the oversized Latin lowercase. 
</p>

<p>
Historical models for Rhodium’s design are Fortune (AKA Volta) by Konrad Bauer and Walter Baum, and Rex by Intertype. 
Matthew Carter’s Verdana provided insight into designing type for small sizes and adverse reading environments.
</p>

<p>
The Devanagari glyph set supports contemporary Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali. 
The Latin glyph set supports Adobe’s Latin-3 character set.

The REM font family is a sans serif font ready for corporate and display uses. It features a heavy low contrast combined with outstrokes that get slightly thinner, which is the opposite of the conventional approach. All together gives it a contemporary feeling suitable for modern branding. With more than 960 glyphs the font is ready for complex type setting with four sets of figures, Small Caps and some alternate glyphs. The name REM is an acronym for "Rapid Eye Movement," which refers to a stage of sleep characterized by quick, random eye movements. I dreamt of it and began drawing it from my dream.

<p>Red Hat is a family of typefaces produced in 2 optical sizes and a monospace style, in a range of weights with italics. The fonts were originally commissioned by Paula Scher, Pentagram and designed by Jeremy Mickel, MCKL for the new Red Hat identity.</p>

<p>Red Hat is a fresh take on the geometric sans genre, taking inspiration from a range of American sans serifs including Tempo and Highway Gothic. The Display styles are low contrast and spaced tightly, with a large x-height and open counters. The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Red+Hat+Text">Text</a> styles have a slightly smaller x-height and narrower width for better legibility, are spaced more generously, and have thinned joins for better performance at small sizes. The two families can be used together seamlessly at a range of sizes.</p>

<p>The family has been upgraded to variable fonts with a weight axis (Light to Bold) in June 2021.</p>

<p>The November 2024 update addresses a frequently reported weight issue. The Medium and SemiBold weights now have slightly different weight compared to the previous version, ensuring better weight distribution within the design space and improved fluidity in the variable font.</p>

Ravi Prakash is a Telugu display typeface, mainly suitable for headings, posters and decorative invitations.
As a web font it should be used in very large pixel sizes, while in print the design may be used in a broader range of sizes, perhaps even as small as at 16pt. 
</p>
<p>
The Telugu is designed by Appaji Ambarisha Darbha in 2013 and made available by Silicon Andhra under the SIL Open Font License v1.1.
The Latin is designed by Eduardo Tunni and originally published as <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Joti+One">Joti One</a>.

<p>Rationale One is a compact monoline webfont designed to work well on screen from large headlines to 12 pt body copy.</p> <p>The concept was to create a modular-based font with optical corrections guided by snap eye judgements. Such irregularities add a warm impression to the overall strict geometrical logic.</p> <p>The idea of subtle stroke cuts originated from the letter n, and was selectively incorporated throughout the characters. This feature becomes visible from 36 pt and above. In body sizes stroke cuts enrich the typographic color with light nuances.</p> <p>Designed by Alexei Vanyashin in cooperation with Olexa Volochay and Vladimir Pavlikov.</p><p>
Intended for continuous reading on the web (longer articles
in online news, magazines, blogs), Rasa supports over 92
languages in Latin and 2 in Gujarati script (Gujarati and Kachchi). The fonts supports a wide array of basic and
compound syllables used in Gujarati.
A Latin-only version is available as <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Yrsa">Yrsa</a>.
In terms of glyphs included Rasa is a superset of Yrsa and includes the complete Latin, but in Rasa the Latin may be
adjusted to support the primary Gujarati font.
</p>
<p>
It is a deliberate experiment in remixing existing typefaces: 
The Latin part began with Eben Sorkin's <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather">Merriweather</a>.

Rakkas is single-weight display typeface that supports the Arabic and Latin scripts.
The two scripts share a united style, with neither pretending to be the other, and each interesting in its own right.
The Arabic design is inspired by Ruq'ah lettering on Egyptian movie posters from the 50s and 60s, and makes use of contextual alternates to emulate calligraphy.
It offers different forms for many letter position and it cascades vertically, giving the user an opportunity to play.
The Latin design infuses a blackletter design with informality.

Rajdhani has modularized letterforms and supports the Devanagari and Latin writing systems. 
The squared and condensed appearance may be interpreted as technical or even futuristic. 
Typically round bowls and other letterform elements have straight sides in Rajdhani. 
The stroke terminals typically end in flat line segments that are horizontal or vertical, rather than diagonal. 
Their corners are slightly rounded, giving stroke-endings a softer feeling, rather than a pointy one.
</p>
<p>
Satya Rajpurohit and Jyotish Sonowal developed the Devanagari component together, while the Latin was designed by Shiva Nalleperumal.

Radley is based on lettering originally drawn and designed for woodcarved titling work.
It was later digitized and extended to be used on the web.
Radley is a practical face, based on letterforms used by hand carvers who cut letters quickly, efficiently, and with style.
It can be used for both titling and text typography.
</p>
<p>
The basic letterforms in Radley grew out of sketching and designing directly into wood with traditional carving chisels.
These were scanned and traced into FontForge and cleaned up digitally, then the character set was expanded.
There is something unique about carving letters into wood with traditional hand tools, and hopefully Radley carries some of the original spirit of these hand carved letterforms.
</p>
<p>
Since the initial launch in 2012, Radley was updated by Vernon Adams adding an Italic and support for more Latin languages.
He made many glyph refinements throughout the family based on user feedback.
In 2017 the family was updated by Marc Foley to complete the work started by Vernon.

    CBC/Radio-Canada is Canada's national public broadcaster. Their mandate is to inform, enlighten and entertain, in order to strengthen Canadian culture on radio, television and digital platforms.
</p>
<p>
    The Radio-Canada font was created in 2017 by Montreal-based designer and typographer Charles Daoud, in collaboration with Coppers and Brasses and Alexandre Saumier Demers. It was designed specifically for CBC/Radio-Canada as a brand unifying information
    font for all the Public Broadcaster’s platforms. Fittingly, for a Public Broadcaster, this is a peoples’ font and the humanistic style stands out with distinctive angles and subtle curves. Its x-height ensures excellent legibility and respects digital
    accessibility standards, making it very effective when used in continuous text.
</p>
<p>
    In 2018, the Radio-Canada font won three awards, in the Font Design category at Communication Arts Typography, Applied Arts Design Annual and at Grand Prix Grafika.
</p>
<p>
    Several optimizations saw the light of day in 2021. The number of supported languages has increased from 106 to 317 Latin languages. In 2023, Jacques Le Bailly (Baron von Fonthausen) expanded the font to include the support of Indigenous languages.

Maybe because the were derived from the more traditional serif typefaces of the time.</p><p>But for same reason, as the genre evolved, the fashion was to create 'monoline' sans, of very little contrast.

INTERNAL TESTING
The Lobster font took a different approach. 
The new OpenType format gives us the possibility to have multiple versions of each letter, and that's exactly what we are doing: Instead of compromising the design of our letters to force connections, we do what lettering artist do. 
We draw many versions of each letter and a lot of different letter-pairs (aka "ligatures") so we always use the best possible variation of each letter depending of the context of the letter inside each word. 
All this happens automatically in any browser that supports ligatures.
</p>
<p>Purple Purse draws its inspiration from a vintage Ivory Soap ad from the
1950's. Somewhat of a cross between Bodoni and Pixie, this font finds
that it never truly takes itself seriously. The fun little bounce of the

<p>I started drawing letters with a computer when I first got one of my own in 1997. I’d been studying sans serif type as a project on the Typography &amp; Graphic Communication course that I was taking at Reading University, and learning about the different strands of development: ‘grotesques’ such as the delightful Monotype Series 215 were designed by type cutters or draftsmen, while geometric and humanist sans serifs like Futura and Gill Sans were constructed with compasses or quills by rationalist typographers and calligraphers. In the end, of course, they all needed a little wash and brush-up from the typefounder – to say nothing of the type designs. I was also in thrall of a typeface called Ehrhardt, a Monotype revival typeface that is based on a seventeenth century design by Miklos Kis. It too had endured a lot of cleaning, but though they were hard on the source material, those responsible created a very elegant condensed typeface. The result looks a bit like a house on an Amsterdam canal.</p> <p>Puritan was my response to these influences; it was also a way (I thought) that I could get hold of an interesting typeface without unofficially borrowing from the Typography department. It might be flawed, but it was mine! Well, I learned a lot from the experience.</p> <p>I wrote a short essay about Puritan as a project in my final year as an undergraduate. Rather than repeat it all here, I have converted the essay (presented as a booklet) into <a href="http://readingtype.org.uk/type/fonts/afterthoughts.pdf"> a PDF file</a> of around 1200K which you can download.</p> <p>In October 1999, I submitted Puritan to the 3rd International Type Design Contest, where it made absolutely no impact.</p><p>

Prompt in Thai means &#8220;ready,&#8221; the same as in English. 
Prompt is a loopless Thai and sans Latin typeface. 
The simple and geometric Latin was developed to work harmoniously with the loopless Thai that has wide proportions and airy negative space. 
It is suitable for both web and print usage, such as magazines, newspapers, and posters. 
</p>
<p>
A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
Formal loopless Thai typefaces are simplified, compared to traditional looped Thai types, and this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the essense of each character. 
The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks has been managed carefully, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.
</p>

The Prompt project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

Pridi means &#8220;joyful&#8221; in Thai. 
Pridi is a slab serif Latin and looped Thai typeface that is well-suited for both body text and display. 
The looped Terminal Thai is designed specifically within loopless terminal concepts, and works well with the slab serif Latin without adding any slabs to any Thai glyphs. 
This font can be used as a body text in various media such as magazines, advertisements, and other print media.
</p>
<p>
A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, and ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
Pridi has a specific approach to the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. 
Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. 
Informal looped Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal ones, and this allows designers to extend the font to heavier weights. 
The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks need to be managed carefully, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.

</p><p>Press Start 2P is a bitmap font based on the font design from 1980s Namco
arcade games. It works best at sizes of 8px, 16px and other multiples of 8.
Although the design of uppercase letters and digits dates back to Atari's
"Sprint" (1977), the specific glyph forms in this TrueType conversion are based
on those from "Return of Ishtar" (1986), one of the first games to include and
regularly use lowercase as well as uppercase letters in its screen font.</p>
<p>Unlike the original font from the "Return of Ishtar" ROM, Press Start 2P
includes a wide variety of non-ASCII Unicode characters for pan-European use,
including Greek and Cyrillic. It could be expanded to support other scripts.</p>

<p>Port Lligat Slab is a display typeface. It has a soft variation in strokes, condensed structure, vertical stress, and a well balance groovy rhythm. It is particularly useful for both short text and headlines, but it is also comfortable for reading on screen. It is designed to become a super family with styles in many different typographical categories matching the exactly weight and width across the whole family. As a result they can be used together in many different ways.  The first releases are the regular Roman styles of the Sans and Slab families. The Slab matches exactly with the Sans but it has heavy slab serifs and rounded terminals. In small sizes it looks like a groovy serif typeface.</p><p>Port Lligat Sans is a display typeface.

Geometric sans serif typefaces have always been popular, and with support for both the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, Poppins is an internationalist addition to the genre.
</p>
<p>
Many of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more constructed and rationalist than is typical. 
The Devanagari design was particularly novel when it was first published in 2015, and was the first ever Devanagari typeface with a range of weights in this genre.
Just like the Latin, the Devanagari is based on pure geometry, particularly circles.
</p>
<p>
Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary to maintain an even typographic color. 
The Devanagari base character height and the Latin ascender height are equal;
Latin capital letters are shorter than the Devanagari characters, and the Latin x-height is set rather high.
</p>
<p>
The project was developed by Indian Type Foundry (ITF).
The Devanagari was initially designed by Ninad Kale, while the Latin was initially designed by Jonny Pinhorn.
Following their principal phase of designing the first 5 styles, the typeface was later refined, and expanded to include multiple weights and italics, by the ITF studio team.

<p>Pompiere is a low contrast condensed sans serif font. However unlike most sans it has very tall ascenders and and very small x height. Pompiere is playful and even a little sweet. This font was inspired by a handmade sign seen outside of NYC firefighters Squad Co. 18 in the West Village of Manhattan. Because of its small x height and modest weight it will work best at medium to large sizes.</p>

<p>Poly is a medium contrast serif font. With short ascenders and a very high x-height, Poly is efficient in small sizes. Thanks to its careful balance between the x-height and glyph widths, it allows more economy and legibility than standard web serifs, even in small sizes. This font was originally designed to compose texts in agglutinative languages; these contain very long words. The goal was to develop a typeface that would tolerate cramped tracking and that would increase the number of letters on a single line.</p> <p>Poly is a Unicode typeface family that supports Open Type features and languages that use the Latin script and its variants, especially Native South American language families.</p><p>
    Półtawski Nowy is a digitisation project the Antykwa Półtawskiego typeface. A key aspect of the design of the digital version of the typeface from 1928 was the approach to the issue of developing the shape of characters from sources. Historical research was carried out in parallel with the preparation of the computer version, which allowed to learn about the unique story of this most recognizable Polish font design. The Półtawski Nowy type family is intended for typesetting in sizes from 10 to 18 pt. The project is implemented thanks to the support of the Digital Culture 2020 program of the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage.
</p>
<p>
    In the Półtawski Nowy digitisation, the source of the study were scans of a type specimen book from the Idźkowski i S-ka foundry, a set of drawings, punch patterns and punches made by Monotype in Salfords, Great Britain in 1934-1955. They were made available by the Type Archive London. Thanks to the standardization of characters and the balancing of the typographic rhythm, in the digital version, the typeface retains its ornamental character, while working well in smaller text sizes. The basic character set available in the sources has been extended with further variants of diacritics, small caps, subscript and superscript, variants of numbers (tabular, proportional, nautical) and a set of OpenType features.

Inspired by the hand painted signs in supermarkets, and the roman structures of the classical alphabets.
Poetsen is a display font, but it's not just intended to be used on big 'straight to the eye' titles.
Since it has a large x-height, it can be used on short paragraphs in relatively small bodies of text too.

Podkova is the Russian word for Horseshoe, and this is a monoline slab serif with diagonal terminals. 
The wide proportions and clean features aid legibility at small sizes, while the unusual letterforms provide enough character to be useful for display typography too.

    Plus Jakarta Sans is a fresh take on geometric sans serif styles, designed by Gumpita Rahayu from Tokotype.
    The fonts were originally commissioned by 6616 Studio for Jakarta Provincial Government program's <em>+Jakarta City
        of Collaboration</em> identity in 2020.

</p>

<p>
    Taking inspiration in Neuzeit Grotesk, Futura, and 1930s grotesque sans serifs with almost monolinear
    contrast and pointy curves, the fonts consist of modern and clean cut forms, the x-height dimension slightly taller
    to provide clear spaces between caps and x-height, and also equipped with open counters and balanced spaces to
    preserve the legibility at a large range of sizes.
</p>

<p>
    The beauty of diversity captured in typography. Like the city itself, the uniqueness of this font is that in
    some glyphs it has its own diversity and characteristic of various explorations of forms that enrich the expressions
    and stories that coexist. The charms of Plus Jakarta Sans fonts appear when one looks closer, manifesting in a
    beauty that emerges once seen as a whole. Each alternate in the family contains several alternative characters,
    divided into three stylistic sets which Lancip (Sharp), Lurus (Straight), and Lingkar (Swirl).
</p>

<p>
    As part of <em>+Jakarta City of Collaboration</em>, the fonts are made available for public use under the SIL

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter/word spacing. To create a versatile tool for teachers when designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. In Playwrite Guides fonts the underscore prints only the guidelines, and matches the width of the normal word space.

<h4>Playwrite South Africa characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This continuous cursive features a gentle slope and a relatively slow pace of
	construction. The uppercase letters incorporate cursive elements, with looped
	descenders in 'G', 'J', 'Y', and 'Z', enhancing their fluidity. The lowercase
	letters have looped ascenders and descenders to support seamless connections
	between letters. Notably, this style does not include curved entry strokes in
	'm', 'n', 'v', and 'w', which is a departure from typical continuous cursives.
	However, it includes distinctly curved shapes in the letters 'x' and 'z',
	adding a dynamic element to the overall script.

    Playwrite Việt Nam Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+VN">Playwrite Việt Nam</a>. It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	In Vietnam, an official handwriting model for teaching in primary schools was
	adopted in 2002. It is called the <em>mẫu chữ thảo tiếng việt</em>, or
	<em>Vietnamese official cursive script</em>, and has been in use from academic
	year 2002-03 onwards. Based on this model, students learn to write in both
	upright and (optionally) sloped cursive letters, without ever being taught
	print letters. Nevertheless, they do practice drawing the basic strokes that
	make up letters in preparation. Handwriting education happens between Grades 1
	to 3, and while students are introduced to writing using a pencil, they
	graduate to writing with fountain pens while they are still in primary school.

<p>
	The model follows the structure and proportions of the upright, monolinear
	version of the Vietnamese official cursive script. These are the versions that
	are prioritized for teaching, while others may be introduced if the situation
	is conducive. The letter shapes derive from the French traditional vertical
	cursive writing, featuring long ascenders and descenders and round and fully
	joined lowercases. Letters 'b', 'r', 'v', and 'w' make use of knots to change
	the stroke direction, 'n' and 'm' have curved entry strokes and 'x' is created
	by means of two mirrored curves. Notable upper case features are the triangular
	yet decorative shapes of 'A', 'V' and 'W', and an 'S' with an upright spine.

    Playwrite USA Traditional Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+US+Trad">Playwrite USA Traditional</a>.

These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	In the absence of a unified national approach, elementary education in the
	United States is supported by several private companies that espouse different
	approaches to teaching handwriting. According to American handwriting expert
	Kate Gladstone, it is difficult to confidently determine which handwriting
	models are most commonly taught in the country, but among the most widespread
	are Zaner-Bloser and D’Nealian, both following a traditional style, and
	Handwriting Without Tears. Two other programs featuring
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+US+Modern">
    modern cursive models</a>
	— Getty-Dubay and Barchowsky Fluent Hand — are rapidly gaining interest as
	writing models not only for children but also for adults seeking to improve
	their handwriting.

<h4>Playwrite USA Traditional characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This style follows the traditional American style of Zaner-Bloser and
	D'Nealian, featuring a slanted continuous cursive. Capital letters vary in
	appearance, with some like 'I', 'H', and 'G' being more decorative, and others
	such as 'A', 'N', and 'M' maintaining a cursive style. The construction of the
	letters appears fast and is complex in certain characters. Ascenders and
	descenders include loops to facilitate continuous writing, with mirrored loops
	in 'p' and 'q' enhancing the flow. Consistent with other English-speaking
	models, the entry strokes for 'v' and 'w' are distinctly different.
</p>

<h4>Playwrite USA Modern characteristics</h4>

	This style is a straightforward, completely upright modern cursive. The
	uppercase letters adopt a simplified print style, with notable features
	including a serif on 'I' and an 'M' with a raised center. The lowercase letters
	are semi-connected and designed with loopless, medium-length ascenders and
	descenders. Unusually for this style, the letters 'm', 'n', and 'r' begin with
	a curved entry stroke, which adds a subtle complexity to the otherwise
	streamlined appearance of the script.

	In 2020, the latest iteration of the <em>Rámcový Učebný Plán</em>, or Framework
	Curriculum, was published by the <em>Ministerstvo</em>. It provides a sample of
	fully-joined, cursive writing based on <em>‘Zjednodušená psací latinka‘</em>,
	or Simplified Latin script, which was ratified by the government of erstwhile
	Czechoslovakia in 1932. According to the curriculum, students must learn to
	write based on this model, following its letter shapes as well as slant.
</p>
<p>
	The Ministerstvo has been sharing this model with private publishers since
	1993, and in the absence of official digitization, publishers have produced

	'Q' and a vertical spine in 'S'. Lowercase letters have loops on extenders but
	lack knots, with the exception of the German-style 't'. Several lowercase
	letters begin with curved entry strokes. The letter 'z' is styled in a plain
	italic form and does not have a descender.

<p>
	The curriculum goals for <em>Comunicare în limba română</em>, or Communication
	in the Romanian language, place importance on teaching handwriting. Instruction
	happens during the early years of primary education, specifically in
	preparatory, first, and second grades. While schools and teachers have some
	flexibility in their methods, the instruction process, its stages, and writing
	models are widely standardized.
</p>
<p>
	Handwriting education begins in preparatory grade with a focus on print script
	alphabet, also known as <em>‘scris de tipar‘</em> or <em>‘litere bloc’</em>,
	and on development of communication skills. In first grade, students gradually
	transition to a cursive writing model called <em>‘litere de mână‘</em>. It is a
	continuous cursive style with a 18º slope, and its narrow proportions follow a
	grid.

These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	Even though writing may be introduced in preschool, systematic teaching of
	handwriting only happens in the 1° Cycle. Since schools have pedagogic autonomy
	in Portugal, there are differences in how handwriting is taught. However, it
	should be noted that they must meet the curriculum goals set out by the
	government and are subject to periodic external evaluations. Schools usually
	begin with <em>‘letra impressa’</em>, or print script letters, starting with
	capital letters for students aged 5–6 years old, before moving to a fully
	joined, vertical cursive writing, known as <em>‘escrita vertical’</em>. There
	are also some traditional schools that start handwriting teaching with
	<em>letra de mão/manuscrita</em>, or cursive letters from the beginning.

	Even though writing may be introduced in preschool, systematic teaching of
	handwriting only happens in the 1° Cycle. Since schools have pedagogic autonomy
	in Portugal, there are differences in how handwriting is taught. However, it
	should be noted that they must meet the curriculum goals set out by the
	government and are subject to periodic external evaluations. Schools usually
	begin with <em>‘letra impressa’</em>, or print script letters, starting with
	capital letters for students aged 5–6 years old, before moving to a fully
	joined, vertical cursive writing, known as <em>‘escrita vertical’</em>. There
	are also some traditional schools that start handwriting teaching with
	<em>letra de mão/manuscrita</em>, or cursive letters from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Portugal is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to
	Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.
	It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, 
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+PT+Guides">Playwrite PT Guides</a>, 
	designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a 
	visual aid for primary school children.

<h4>Playwrite Portugal characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This upright continuous cursive model features decorative capital letters, with
	a notably distinctive 'Q' and an 'S' with a vertical stem. The lowercase
	letters are constructed slowly and carefully, displaying medium-length, looped
	ascenders and descenders. Letters 'm', 'n', 'v', and 'w' begin with curved
	entry strokes, while 'z' is characterized by a flat top. Additionally, the
	letter 'f' has a mirrored descender loop, and the letters 'o', 'v', 'w', and
	'z' include knots, enhancing the stylistic intricacy of this handwriting model.

    Playwrite Polska Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+PL">Playwrite Polska</a>. It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	Poland’s <em>podstawa programowa</em>, or core curriculum, is published by the
	<em>Ministerstwo</em>, and available online, where it is continuously
	maintained. It mentions handwriting education very briefly, stating that the
	country’s goal is that students must learn to write by hand, legibly and
	fluently, in sentences and continuous text.
</p>
<p>
	In Poland, the prevalent handwriting education model is a loopless,
	fully-joined vertical cursive, and students are taught upper and lower cases
	simultaneously. Handwriting primers show samples of this style alongside
	instructions on how to draw them. When it comes to reading, students learn that
	through a serif typeface.

	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter/word spacing. To create a versatile tool for teachers when designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. In Playwrite Guides fonts the underscore prints only the guidelines, and matches the width of the normal word space.

<h4>Playwrite Perú characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This upright continuous cursive handwriting model features medium-length

	French vertical cursives. The lowercase letters have looped extenders and
	showcase a unique two-stroke construction of 'k'. The letter 'f' is
	characterized by a straight descender, while 'v' and 'w' are noted for their
	knots, adding to the distinctiveness of this cursive style.

    Playwrite New Zealand Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+NZ">Playwrite New Zealand</a>.

<p>
	The style of handwriting currently taught in New Zealand is specified in
	<em>Teaching Handwriting</em>, a Ministry of Education publication, which was developed
	in response to teachers’ requests for guidance on the style of handwriting that

	document. It was first released in 1985 and again in digital format in 2008.
	Even though <em>Teaching Handwriting</em> outlines a progressive handwriting system that

	will not teach the latter if it is not practical given their students' learning
	levels and other curriculum needs.

	This modern cursive style is extremely fast and slanted, featuring simplified
	print-style uppercase letters. Notable are the open 'G' without a crossbar, a
	serifed 'I', and a 'Y' with a slanted stem. The lowercase letters are
	semi-connected, exhibiting a very fast and angular construction typical of
	modern cursive styles based on italic forms. The letter 'f' has a straight
	descender, and 'q' is distinguished by a short exit stroke that serves as a
	finial, enhancing the dynamic and streamlined appearance of the script.

</p>
<p>
	In The Netherlands, handwriting education commonly begins in <em>Groep</em> 3
	after students have learned fine and gross motor skills in previous years. The
	most widely used handwriting model in classrooms is <em>verbonden schrift</em>,
	a slanted continuous cursive with loops. However, teachers have increasingly
	opted for <em>blokschrift</em>, which features unjoined, simplified print
	letters. Some teachers choose to instruct in both models: one after another,
	together, or in a permutation that suits their students.

	In The Netherlands, handwriting education commonly begins in <em>Groep</em> 3
	after students have learned fine and gross motor skills in previous years. The
	most widely used handwriting model in classrooms is <em>verbonden schrift</em>,
	a slanted continuous cursive with loops. However, teachers have increasingly
	opted for <em>blokschrift</em>, which features unjoined, simplified print
	letters. Some teachers choose to instruct in both models: one after another,
	together, or in a permutation that suits their students.

<p>
	Playwrite Netherland is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to

<h4>Playwrite Netherland characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This slanted fully joined handwriting style includes cursive uppercases, with
	the exception of 'S', and features complex shapes in letters such as 'I' and
	'J'. The lowercase letters showcase long ascenders and descenders, each
	furnished with loops, enhancing the fluidity of the script. Curved entry
	strokes are present in the letters 'm', 'n', 'v', 'w', 'x', and 'y',
	contributing to the overall smooth and flowing appearance. The letter 'z'
	stands out as it is specifically constructed in an italic style, adding a
	distinct contrast within the script.

    Playwrite Nigeria Modern Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+NG+Modern">Playwrite Nigeria Modern</a>. It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	In Nigeria, there is an emphasis on students receiving instruction in the
	language they hear and use every day. This poses a challenge in a country with
	limited resources and great linguistic diversity. Apart from four widely spoken
	languages — Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba and English — there are hundreds of regional
	languages as well as dialects. As a result, teacher training and educational
	resources are required for several languages.
</p>
<p>
	In the past, before the widespread use of computers, there was greater emphasis
	on handwriting. Today, while private schools with more resources may adopt
	foreign models like 
    <a href="https://primarium.info/handwriting-models/nelson-handwriting/">Nelson Handwriting</a>, 
    public schools face financial constraints, impacting their ability to prioritize 
    handwriting education. Given these circumstances, the handwriting style learned 
    by students is often influenced by the habits of their parents and teachers, 
    and they end up	mimicking what they see around them.

<h4>Playwrite Nigeria Modern Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter/word spacing. To create a versatile tool for teachers when designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. In Playwrite Guides fonts the underscore prints only the guidelines, and matches the width of the normal word space.

<h4>Playwrite Nigeria Modern characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Following the tradition and current use of these booklets, Playwrite Nigeria
	Modern is a very slanted continuous cursive. Its lowercase letters have
	medium-length ascenders and descenders with loops that favor writing whole
	words without pen lifts. Based on the Palmer style, these loops are mirrored in
	the descending strokes of letters 'f' and 'q'. Some uppercase letters, such as
	the 'G', 'L', and 'Z', have decorative and complex cursive shapes.

<h4>Playwrite México characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This slanted continuous cursive closely mirrors North American models such as
	Palmer or Zaner-Bloser. The uppercase letters are cursive and include some
	complex shapes, notably in 'F', 'I', and 'G'. The lowercase letters feature
	medium-length extenders, with 'f' and 'q' displaying mirrored descender loops

	Italy holds an important place in the historical development of handwriting
	styles. Handwriting produced in the Latin script finds its roots in the models

	taught in Italy is an
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+IT+Moderna">
    upright cursive style</a>
	developed in the early to mid-20th century, which, according to handwriting
	expert Francesco Ascoli, was prescribed in the country’s national guidelines in
	1945.
</p>
<p>
	At the beginning of the 21st century, the decline in the quality of handwriting
	in Italy caught the attention of the educational community. To rectify this
	situation, educators and handwriting experts started to explore different ways
	to improve instruction in primary schools by revamping approaches and resources

    Playwrite Ísland Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+IS">Playwrite Ísland</a>. It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	The latest edition of the national curriculum, published in 2014, requires that
	at the end of fourth grade, students must “write all the letters, write clearly
	and understandably.” Handwriting teaching in Iceland happens during grades 1-3
	(6-9 years old), and books by the MMS adhere to a progressive system based on
	simplified modern italic styles.
</p>
<p>
	According to this system, students should first be introduced to the lowercase
	letters of <em>Grunnskrift</em> or the initial model. These are simplified and
	unconnected letters, slightly slanted and with exit strokes. This should be
	followed by uppercase letters of the same model. Finally, in the third grade
	(8-9 years old), students learn <em>Tengiskrift</em> or joined letters.

<h4>Playwrite Ísland characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This slanted modern cursive handwriting is crafted for high-speed writing and
	features print-style uppercase letters, with 'M' notably having splain legs.
	The lowercase letters are inspired by early Italic calligraphies, including the
	chancery style. Letters that end with a descender do not connect to the
	subsequent character, making this a semi-connected model. Both 'b' and 'p'
	feature closed bowls, while 'z' and 'r' are designed with an italic structure,
	stressing the script’s aesthetic and functional attributes.

    Playwrite Ireland Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+IE">Playwrite Ireland</a>. It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	The NCAA publishes the national curriculum, and issues of language are dealt
	with in the <em>“Primary Language Curriculum”</em>, which was last published in
	2019. This document is fully bilingual in English and Irish Gaelic. An
	additional guideline document for teachers called
	<em>”Primary Language Curriculum. Support Material for teachers. Writing”</em>,
	is also published by the NCAA. This devotes a full section to handwriting and
	suggests that children can be introduced to cursive writing as early as the
	junior infant level.
</p>
<p>
	In practice, however, each school can choose its own methods for teaching
	handwriting. Most teachers start with either print script (locally called
	“manuscript”) or precursive letters in junior and senior infant levels. From
	Class 1 onwards, students are taught to add exit strokes to letters and then
	connect them to achieve a cursive hand.

	The NCAA publishes the national curriculum, and issues of language are dealt
	with in the <em>“Primary Language Curriculum”</em>, which was last published in
	2019. This document is fully bilingual in English and Irish Gaelic. An
	additional guideline document for teachers called
	<em>”Primary Language Curriculum. Support Material for teachers. Writing”</em>,
	is also published by the NCAA. This devotes a full section to handwriting and
	suggests that children can be introduced to cursive writing as early as the
	junior infant level.
</p>
<p>
	In practice, however, each school can choose its own methods for teaching
	handwriting. Most teachers start with either print script (locally called
	“manuscript”) or precursive letters in junior and senior infant levels. From
	Class 1 onwards, students are taught to add exit strokes to letters and then
	connect them to achieve a cursive hand.

<h4>Playwrite Ireland characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This model showcases a sloped, continuous cursive style where uppercase letters
	connect to the following letter whenever possible. The letter 'H' is notable
	for its distinctive crossbar shape. Unlike other models in this category,
	lowercase letters have short extenders with loops but do not start with curved
	entry strokes. The construction of the bowls in 'b' and 'p' differs
	significantly from each other. The letter 'z' features a curved top and a
	looped descender.

    Playwrite Playwrite Hrvatska Lijeva Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+HR+Lijeva">Playwrite Playwrite Hrvatska Lijeva</a>. It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	The seeds for the standardization of Croatian handwriting education were sown
	in 2007 when the Ministry of Education promoted a series of research projects
	that yielded numerous resources focused on Croatian language education,
	particularly for reading and writing. Among these was a handbook for
	handwriting education by Ante Bežen and Siniša Reberski, an influential work in
	the standardization of handwriting instruction from 2013 onwards. In first
	grade, students match letters with sounds and learn to recognize them in the
	context of words by means of print-style letters. From second grade, students
	must write using a continuous and fully joined cursive called
	<em>‘rukopisno pismo’</em>.

    Playwrite England SemiJoined Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+GB+S">Playwrite England SemiJoined</a>. It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	England has been the incubator for several prominent handwriting styles that
	still influence teaching around the world. One of the earliest examples is the
	English Roundhand, which was used in business and education in the 19th
	century.
</p>
<p>
	The implementation of modern cursive styles in classrooms is probably the most
	influential development for contemporary handwriting education. They draw from
	the ideas of the Italic Handwriting Revival movement of the early 20th century,
	and the work of its proponents. Alfred Fairbank (1895–1982) proposed modern
	italic writing, based on chancery models, as a new approach to teaching
	handwriting with the aim of simplification and faster writing speed. Recently,
	it has been one of the most popular approaches to handwriting teaching in
	England. Of the twenty-three methods described in the National Handwriting
	Association’s 2013 guide to writing methods for teaching, thirteen were
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+GB+J">fully joined</a> or
	semi-joined modern cursive styles. Important among these are Nelson
	Handwriting, Tom Gourdie Modern Hand, Jarman Handwriting, Marion Richardson,
	and Sassoon-Williams model.

<h4>Playwrite England SemiJoined characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This semi-connected modern cursive is offered in both upright and slanted
	(italic) versions. It features short, loopless ascenders and descenders, with
	simplified print-like uppercase letters. Notable characteristics include an
	open 'G' without a crossbar and an 'M' with plain legs. The lowercase 'f' has a
	curved descending stroke, and the 'q' is distinguished by a flick in its
	descender. True to this style, there are no curved entry strokes, and letters
	ending in a right-to-left stroke, such as 'b', 'p', 'g', and 's', do not
	connect to the following letter.

</p>
<p>
	The <em>‘écriture cursive’</em>, or
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+FR+Trad">
    traditional vertical cursive</a>, is the most used approach to handwriting teaching in schools in France. Its
	forms are inspired by the <em>‘Lettre Ronde’</em>, originally written with a
	broad nib pen and ink. Students learn <em>‘écriture cursive‘</em> by writing
	letters over <em>Séyès lines</em>, which are introduced during kindergarten
	(age ~5). Created in 1892, Séyès lines are a system of horizontal and vertical
	guidelines that govern the proportions of letters, and their ascending and
	descending strokes.
</p>
<p>
	In an attempt to reform and modernize handwriting teaching in schools, the
	Ministère released two digital typeface families in 2013 —
	<em>Écriture A</em> by Laurence Bedoin-Collard and Heloísa Tissot, and
	<em>Écriture B</em>, by Marion Andrews. Both fonts follow a
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+FR+Moderne">
    modern cursive style</a>
	and are available for free on the Ministère’s website, along with information
	for teachers about the shapes and proportions of letters, and how to connect
	them to form words in the most logical way possible.

	The <em>‘écriture cursive’</em>, or
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+FR+Trad">
    traditional vertical cursive</a>, is the most used approach to handwriting teaching in schools in France. Its
	forms are inspired by the <em>‘Lettre Ronde’</em>, originally written with a
	broad nib pen and ink. Students learn <em>‘écriture cursive‘</em> by writing
	letters over <em>Séyès lines</em>, which are introduced during kindergarten
	(age ~5). Created in 1892, Séyès lines are a system of horizontal and vertical
	guidelines that govern the proportions of letters, and their ascending and

<h4>Playwrite France Traditionnelle characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Closely following the <em>Écriture Droite</em> structure, this upright
	continuous cursive showcases very long ascenders and descenders and is
	characterized by round shapes that are executed slowly. The uppercase letters
	are decorative, with some, like 'R' and 'Y', designed to facilitate connections
	to subsequent letters. The lowercase 'f' features a mirrored bottom loop.
	Additionally, letters 'm', 'n', 'v', 'w', 'y', and notably 'z', start with a
	curved entry stroke, enhancing the fluidity of the script.
</p>

	code ‘FR’ and a the ‘Trad’ abbreviation, <strong>Playwrite FR Trad</strong>. It
	features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.

    Playwrite Danmark Uloopet Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DK+Uloopet">Playwrite Danmark Uloopet</a>. It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	In 2019, the Ministry of Children and Education outlined the government's
	primary education requirements in a document called "Danish Common Goals". It
	specifies that second-grade students must be able to write upper and lowercase
	letters by hand and using the keyboard, and by fourth grade they are expected
	to write in legible, connected handwriting. Accordingly, handwriting
	instruction starts during preschool with simplified print letters. Given the
	autonomy to choose their preferred teaching methods and models, teachers and
	schools opt between two cursive models during the middle of the second or the
	beginning of the third year — the unlooped <em>Grundskrift</em>, or its
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DK+Loopet">

	In 2019, the Ministry of Children and Education outlined the government's
	primary education requirements in a document called "Danish Common Goals". It
	specifies that second-grade students must be able to write upper and lowercase
	letters by hand and using the keyboard, and by fourth grade they are expected
	to write in legible, connected handwriting. Accordingly, handwriting
	instruction starts during preschool with simplified print letters. Given the
	autonomy to choose their preferred teaching methods and models, teachers and
	schools opt between two cursive models during the middle of the second or the
	beginning of the third year —
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DK+Uloopet">
    the unlooped <em>Grundskrift</em></a>, or its looped variation known as <em>Grundskrift med løkker</em>.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Danmark Loopet is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100)
	to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.

<h4>Playwrite Danmark Loopet characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This typographic hybrid draws from fully joined modern cursives but includes
	looped ascenders. It features a slanted orientation with short ascenders and
	descenders, creating a round and restrained appearance. The capital letters are
	mostly simplified and print-like, with a very distinctive 'G' that lacks both a
	descender and a crossbar. The lowercase letters connect with each other, except
	for 'q'. A standout feature is the lowercase 'b', which combines a modern
	cursive shape and connecting stroke with an uncharacteristic loop on its
	ascender.

    Playwrite Deutschland Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+VA">Playwrite Deutschland Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift</a>. It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	In Germany, education is regulated at the state level rather than at the
	national level. Each state defines its own models and methods of teaching
	handwriting in primary schools. The common goal is acquiring a personal style
	of connected handwriting at the end of primary school in fourth grade (10-11
	years old). Emphasis is on the flow of connected writing, letter recognition,
	and legibility, not the exact imitation of individual letters.
</p>
<p>
	In most states, teachers and schools can choose from three cursive styles:
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+LA">
	Ausgangsschrift (LA)</a>, Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift (VA), and
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+SAS">
	Schulausgangsschrift (SAS)</a>. But in 2010, the <em>Grundschulverband</em>, 
    or Association of Primary Schools, presented an alternative progressive approach 
    for handwriting	teaching:
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+Grund">Grundschrift</a>, 
    based primarily on a print-style script with some added cursive elements,
	like <em>Häckchen</em>, or exit strokes. Some German states, like Bremen and
	Hamburg, allow this method to be used in schools, in addition to the dominant
	Ausgangschrift systems. According to Das Deutsche Schulportal, Grundschrift is
	taught in 10% of all German schools.

	In Germany, education is regulated at the state level rather than at the
	national level. Each state defines its own models and methods of teaching
	handwriting in primary schools. The common goal is acquiring a personal style
	of connected handwriting at the end of primary school in fourth grade (10-11
	years old). Emphasis is on the flow of connected writing, letter recognition,
	and legibility, not the exact imitation of individual letters.
</p>
<p>
	In most states, teachers and schools can choose from three cursive styles:
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+LA">
    Ausgangsschrift (LA)</a>,
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+VA">
    Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift (VA)</a>, and Schulausgangsschrift (SAS)</a>. 
    But in 2010, the <em>Grundschulverband</em>, or Association of Primary
	Schools, presented an alternative progressive approach for handwriting
	teaching: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+Grund">Grundschrift</a>, 
    based primarily on a print-style script with
	some added cursive elements, like <em>Häckchen</em>, or exit strokes. Some

<h4>Playwrite Deutschland Schulausgangschrift characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This continuous cursive features a medium slope, short extenders, and a
	deliberately slow stroke speed. The capital letters present a restrained
	appearance, with only a few exhibiting decorative or cursive traits. The
	lowercase letters have looped ascenders and descenders, and 'm', 'n', and 'r'
	begin with a curved entry stroke. This typeface displays a German-style 't'
	that can be executed without lifting the pen. The letter 'f' has a straight and
	loopless descender, while 'r' and 'z' are designed with an italic structure.

<p>
	In Germany, education is regulated at the state level rather than at the
	national level. Each state defines its own models and methods of teaching
	handwriting in primary schools. The common goal is acquiring a personal style
	of connected handwriting at the end of primary school in fourth grade (10-11
	years old). Emphasis is on the flow of connected writing, letter recognition,
	and legibility, not the exact imitation of individual letters.
</p>
<p>
	In most states, teachers and schools can choose from three cursive styles:
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+LA">
    Ausgangsschrift (LA)</a>,
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+VA">
    Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift (VA)</a>, and
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+SAS">
    Schulausgangsschrift (SAS)</a>. But in 2010, the <em>Grundschulverband</em>, or Association of Primary
	Schools, presented an alternative progressive approach for handwriting
	teaching: <em>Grundschrift</em>, based primarily on a print-style script with
	some added cursive elements, like <em>Häckchen</em>, or exit strokes. Some
	German states, like Bremen and Hamburg, allow this method to be used in
	schools, in addition to the dominant Ausgangschrift systems. According to Das
	Deutsche Schulportal, Grundschrift is taught in 10% of all German schools.
</p>
<p>
	Playwrite Deutschland Grundschrift is a variable font with a weight range from
	Thin (100) to Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.
	It has a single-weight sibling with Guides, 
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+DE+Grund+Guides">Playwrite DE Grund Guides</a>, 
	designed to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a 
	visual aid for primary school children.

<h4>Playwrite Deutschland Grundschrift characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This style is a simple precursive, entirely disconnected. The uppercase letters
	are simplified print forms, notable for a two-stroke 'R' and an 'M' with a
	raised middle point. Several lowercase letters retain the characteristic exit
	stroke typical of precursives. The letter 'k' is constructed using two strokes,
	and the 'f' features a straight descender, distinguishing it within this
	straightforward style.
</p>

<h4>Family name in font menus</h4>
<p>
	Playwrite Deutschland Grundschrift appears in font menus with a two-letter
	country code ‘DE’ and a the ‘Grund’ abbreviation, <strong>Playwrite DE Grund</strong>.
	It features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and Regular.

<h3>Playwrite fonts for schools</h3>
<p>
	The Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a
	groundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current
	practice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.
	This typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating
	localized libre fonts. These Playwrite fonts are complemented by
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans"> Playpen Sans</a>, an
	informal and fun typeface designed for annotations, instructions, and student
	notes – that also includes emojis.

    Playwrite Colombia Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+CO">Playwrite Colombia</a>. It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	The Colombian cursive style <em>‘letra pegada’</em> is visibly rooted in the
	traditions of the Palmer method, created by Austin Palmer (1860–1927) in the
	United States at the turn of the last century. It has many similarities with
	cursive writing models in North American countries (<a
		href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+US+Trad">
    United States</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+MX">México</a>, and
	Canada), which also descend from the same style. This influence can be seen in
	the <em>‘cartillas’</em> or handwriting education booklets produced by private
	publishers, which play an essential role in the teaching of reading and writing
	in the country.

<h4>Playwrite Colombia characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Following the tradition and current use of these booklets, Playwrite Colombia
	is a very slanted continuous cursive. Its lowercase letters have medium-length
	ascenders and descenders with loops that favor writing whole words without pen
	lifts. Based on the Palmer style, these loops are mirrored in the descending
	strokes of letters 'f' and 'q'. Some uppercase letters, such as the 'G', 'L'
	and 'Z', have decorative and complex cursive shapes.

These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	The most prevalent style of handwriting taught in Chile is known as
	<em>‘letra ligada’</em>, or joined letters. This form of cursive handwriting is
	introduced to children as early as 6 years old, either alongside print letters
	or as a standalone style. It can be seen as a slantless variant of
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+GB+J">English roundhand</a>, a calligraphic style that emerged in England, gaining widespread popularity
	in the 18th century, but Chilean type designers note that, while there are
	structural similarities between the two styles, there are also notable
	differences. For instance, <em>letra ligada</em> typically features shorter
	ascenders and descenders, and its uppercase letters are less ornate. This
	divergence is present in both contemporary typographic and calligraphic
	examples.

These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	The traditional method of handwriting instruction in Canada is called
	<em>MacLean’s Method of Writing</em>, and was developed by educator Henry
	Boyver MacLean in the mid-20th century. Building upon letter shapes devised by
	Austin Norman Palmer in the
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+US+Trad">United States</a>, MacLean introduced several changes to suit the needs of school instruction,
	such as modifications to teaching methods and the addition of motor preparation
	exercises. Even though MacLean’s books have not been used in Canada for several
	years, his letter shapes survive in schoolbooks published by regional
	governments and private publishing houses. They are widely used in the majority
	of Canadian primary schools.

	The traditional method of handwriting instruction in Canada is called
	<em>MacLean’s Method of Writing</em>, and was developed by educator Henry
	Boyver MacLean in the mid-20th century. Building upon letter shapes devised by
	Austin Norman Palmer in the
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+US+Trad">United States</a>, MacLean introduced several changes to suit the needs of school instruction,
	such as modifications to teaching methods and the addition of motor preparation
	exercises. Even though MacLean’s books have not been used in Canada for several
	years, his letter shapes survive in schoolbooks published by regional
	governments and private publishing houses. They are widely used in the majority
	of Canadian primary schools.

	medium-length extenders with loops, which are consistent even in letters like
	'p' and 'q', and are constructed using medium-speed strokes. Additionally,
	several lowercase letters such as 'm', 'n', 'v', 'w', 'y', and 'z' start with
	curved entry strokes at the x-height.

    Playwrite Brasil Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+BR">Playwrite Brasil</a>. It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.

<p>
	Educational Vertical cursive models first appeared in the 19th century in
	France, England, and the USA as simplified forms of their predecessors,
	Roundhand and Spencerian styles, respectively. The upright cursive writing did
	not enjoy a long period of popularity in northern European and Anglo-American
	countries. It was, however, widely adopted in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and
	France, where it is still used. From these countries, it traveled to erstwhile
	colonies such as Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, among others. In
	Brazil, this resulted in the replacement of the then-popular models of
	handwriting, such as Palmer from the
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+US+Trad">US</a> and

    Playwrite België Vlaanderen Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+BE+VLG">Playwrite België Vlaanderen</a>. It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	The Dutch-French language divide in Belgium, a phenomenon with roots stretching
	back to the Middle Ages, continues to be relevant in the country today.
	Traditions of handwriting education exemplify this circumstance and reflect the
	country's historical ties to France and the Netherlands. Regardless of the
	handwriting model adopted, students learn print-style script letters in
	kindergarten and progress to connected letters in primary school. In Flanders,
	there is a preference for sloped continuous cursive writing, reminiscent of
	Dutch handwriting models, whereas the French-speaking community in the
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+BE+VLG">
    Walloon region opts for upright cursive writing</a>, a style that enjoys popularity in France. This diversity in handwriting
	education is a direct response to Belgium's rich linguistic culture, leading to

	All Australian provinces employ modern cursive letters for handwriting

<p>
	This modern cursive includes elements of continuous cursive styles, such as the
	open bowls in 'b' and 'p'. The only loop is on the ascender of 'f', while 'm'
	and 'n' feature curved entry strokes. Letters with descenders, except for 'f',
	do not connect to the next letter, giving a more distinct and clear
	semi-connected appearance. The 'z' has a very open design with a descender. In
	line with other Australian models, 'g' also features an open design. 'M' is
	noted for its plain legs, and 'q' ends with a small exit stroke.

<h4>Playwrite Australia Tasmania characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This semi-connected, slanted modern cursive features print-style capital
	letters. The lowercase letters are loopless, and characters with descenders, as
	well as the letter 's', do not connect to the following letter, allowing for
	faster writing. The style is characterized by a high stroke speed. Notably, the
	letter 'G' is open, and 'Y' has a peculiar design. The 'f' is disconnected with
	a curved descender. The letters 'b' and 'p' have closed bowls, while 'r' and
	'z' are presented in an italic style. Additionally, 'q' finishes with a small
	exit stroke, contributing to the fluidity and distinctiveness of this
	handwriting style.

<h4>Playwrite Australia QLD characteristics</h4>

<p>
	This semi-connected, slanted modern cursive features print-style capital
	letters. The extenders are loopless, and letters with descenders do not connect
	to the next letter, allowing for a fluid and fast writing pace. Notably, 'm'
	and 'n' start with curved entry strokes. Distinctive features include an open
	'G' without a crossbar and a serifed 'I', adding a unique touch. The 'Y' is
	peculiar in its form. The lowercase 'f' is disconnected and features a straight
	descender. The 'q' concludes with a short exit stroke, while the 's' maintains
	a cursive style. The 'z' is designed to be wide and open with a descender,
	enhancing readability and style.
</p>

    Playwrite Argentina Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+AR">Playwrite Argentina</a>. It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.
</p>
<p>
	Primary school curricula in Argentina focus on writing mostly from a
	comprehension and composition standpoint rather than from the perspective of
	handwriting. Even so, primary school students learn how to write with joined
	upright cursive letters from first or second grade. In the initial level,
	students learn print-style uppercase letters, followed by print lowercase
	letters in the first grade, and finally, cursive writing.

<h4>Playwrite Argentina Guides characteristics</h4>

<p>
	Guidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter/word spacing. To create a versatile tool for teachers when designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. In Playwrite Guides fonts the underscore prints only the guidelines, and matches the width of the normal word space.

<h4>Playwrite Argentina characteristics</h4>

<p>
	As it happens in many South American countries, handwriting for primary
	education is rooted in the tradition of
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playwrite+FR+Trad">French Normal</a>
	schools. It is a round, continuous cursive style, and some of its most
	recognizable features are the long ascenders and descender loops,
	semi-connected uppercase letters, curved entry strokes on x-height, the knot in
	the letter 'o', and a crossbar in 'q' that requires a pen lift.

    Playpen Sans Thai was designed by TypeTogether after over two years of primary research into handwriting education for Latin-based languages, available at <a href="https://primarium.info">primarium.info</a>.
</p>
<p>
    It is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to ExtraBold (800). It supports two different writing systems: Thai and Latin, covering Thai and over 332 Latin-based languages, along with a set of “reward icons” as emoji. The superfamily also includes a Pan-African Latin, Greek, Cyrillic (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans">Playpen Sans</a>), Arabic (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans+Arabic">Playpen Sans Arabic</a>), Devanagari (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans+Deva">Playpen Sans Deva</a>), and Hebrew (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans+Hebrew">Playpen Sans Hebrew</a>) fonts that expand the language support of the system.
</p>
<p>
    Playpen Sans Thai has alternate glyphs for each character that are automatically applied as you type, with a built-in shuffler that both ensures variety and avoids repetition. This adds to the overall organic, spontaneous, and authentic feel of the handwritten style.

<h3>Thai</h3>
<p>
    Playpen Sans Thai is a playful and distinctive typeface that reimagines the traditional Thai script with a unique twist. Unlike conventional Thai fonts that rely on simple looped or loopless terminals, this design introduces a subtle yet innovative feature: hook-shaped terminals that hint at the natural starting point of each letter. Inspired by extensive research into the most legible letterforms for graphic novels, this detail not only enhances readability but also adds a touch of whimsy. The flowing strokes capture the fluid, continuous nature of Thai writing, striking a perfect balance between casual and steady—a rhythm that feels neither too fast nor too slow. The result is a font with a lively, fun-loving personality, designed to bring joy and clarity to every word.
</p>
<img src="2025_PPS-Thai_03.jpg" />
<h3>A casual handwriting font</h3>
<p>
    Some typefaces excel at just one thing, while others do multiple things well. Playpen Sans stands out by perfectly imitating casual handwriting, blending the organic feel of something made by hand with the precision of a professional digital typeface. Handwritten text is naturally inconsistent, but digital fonts aim for uniformity. Playpen Sans bridges this gap by offering a set of characters that are “the same, but different,” creating an authentic and human-like appearance within the constraints of digital design. It has a set of clear letterforms that are easy to write and recognize. The design forms a bridge between handwritten and typographic letters, friendly to both little readers and adults.
</p>
<br>
<img src="2025_PPS-Thai_02.jpg" />
<p>
    To achieve this, Playpen Sans includes multiple versions of each character and a built-in shuffler, ensuring no two shapes repeat too closely. This results in text that feels spontaneous, fun, and organic, while maintaining the functionality of a modern typeface. Designed with non-designers in mind, it shines in informal settings like greeting cards, invitations, children’s books, and graphic novels. Its clarifying features, such as straight and curved endings for certain letters and optional shapes, add to its versatility.
</p>
<p>
    Playpen Sans combines the best of both worlds: the aesthetic charm of handwritten text and the technological capabilities of a digital font. It’s spontaneous, authentic, and effortlessly bridges the gap between the organic and the digital.

Built on the backbone of countless hours spent drawing and redrawing Devanagari letters and combinations by hand, the design carefully selects and refines the most organic and intuitive shapes. Subtle variations, including minor gaps in the headlines, add an organic texture that mimics the imperfections of real handwriting. The font emphasizes intuitive retracing, with carefully crafted imperfect joins and even a sprinkle of strategically placed overlaps, creating a warm and approachable handwritten appearance. Moving away from rigid calligraphic rules, Playpen Sans Devanagari honors the everyday ways people draw their letters, incorporating small idiosyncrasies that make the text feel friendly, relatable, and full of character. This design is a tribute to the human touch, blending authenticity with readability for a truly inviting typographic experience.

<h3>A casual handwriting font</h3>
<p>
    Some typefaces excel at just one thing, while others do multiple things well. Playpen Sans stands out by perfectly imitating casual handwriting, blending the organic feel of something made by hand with the precision of a professional digital typeface. Handwritten text is naturally inconsistent, but digital fonts aim for uniformity. Playpen Sans bridges this gap by offering a set of characters that are “the same, but different,” creating an authentic and human-like appearance within the constraints of digital design. It has a set of clear letterforms that are easy to write and recognize. The design forms a bridge between handwritten and typographic letters, friendly to both little readers and adults.
</p>
<br>
<img src="2025_PPS-Deva_03.jpg" />
<p>
    To achieve this, Playpen Sans includes multiple versions of each character and a built-in shuffler, ensuring no two shapes repeat too closely. This results in text that feels spontaneous, fun, and organic, while maintaining the functionality of a modern typeface. Designed with non-designers in mind, it shines in informal settings like greeting cards, invitations, children’s books, and graphic novels. Its clarifying features, such as straight and curved endings for certain letters and optional shapes, add to its versatility.
</p>
<p>
    Playpen Sans combines the best of both worlds: the aesthetic charm of handwritten text and the technological capabilities of a digital font. It’s spontaneous, authentic, and effortlessly bridges the gap between the organic and the digital.

    Playpen Sans Arabic was designed by TypeTogether after over two years of primary research into handwriting education for Latin-based languages, available at <a href="https://primarium.info">primarium.info</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Playpen Sans Arabic is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to ExtraBold (800). It supports two different writing systems: Arabic and Latin, covering 6 Arabic-based languages and over 332 Latin-based ones, along with a set of “reward icons” as emoji. The superfamily also includes a Pan-African Latin, Greek, Cyrillic (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans">Playpen Sans</a>), Devanagari (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans+Deva">Playpen Sans Deva</a>), Hebrew (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans+Hebrew">Playpen Sans Hebrew</a>), and Thai (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans+Thai">Playpen Sans Thai</a>) fonts that expand the language support of the system.
</p>
<p>
   It has alternate glyphs for each character that are automatically applied as you type, with a built-in shuffler that both ensures variety and avoids repetition. This adds to the overall organic, spontaneous, and authentic feel of the handwritten style.

<h3>A casual handwriting font</h3>
<p>
    Some typefaces do more than one thing well, and others excel at just one thing. The Playpen Sans font family excels at imitating casual handwriting with a completely natural look — the aesthetic form of something made by hand – combined with all the functionality of a professional typeface.
</p>
<p>
    The font world has a general tension between what’s organic and what’s digital. When scribbling a quick note, written letters have slight differences, but all look similar because they come from the same person. Digital typefaces are instead almost always very consistent — each character is exactly the same, every time you type it.
</p>
<p>    
    The goal of a typeface that is both casual in look and digital in nature is to appear authentically human within the bounds of digital technology: A typeface with a set of characters that are “the same, but different” that carries the authenticity which everyone craves. The main problem with typical casual fonts is not having enough alternate characters to look real. When a family has more than one alternate, another problem arises in controlling how and when a character gets replaced.
</p>
<br>
<img src="2025_PPS-LGC_03.jpg" />
<p>    
    To solve these problems, Playpen Sans was designed with seven versions of each character, plus a novel and automatic shuffler, so no single shape is repeated in close proximity. The result is text with spontaneous inconsistencies that feel fun and organic… all the benefits of a modern, professional typeface that looks natural.
</p>
<p>    
    The family was made for non-designers, and it shines within short, informal settings: greeting cards and invitations; casual signs; fun documents, and of course, children’s books and educational materials, comic books, and graphic novels. The straight and curved endings for ‘i, l, y’, the two-story ‘a’, and optional shapes for ‘f, G, I, M’ are notable features. 
</p>
<p>    
    Playpen Sans combines technological and aesthetic values, showing the best of both worlds with digital capabilities and a casual, handmade look. Is it spontaneous? Is it authentic? Thankfully, yes, and yes.
</p>
<br>
<img src="PlaypenSans-about4a.png" />
<h3>Greek and Cyrillic</h3>
<p>
    Greek and Cyrillic follow the same principles as Latin, giving the idea that they are all written by the same person. All the writing systems approach letterform construction with casual and continuous strokes; typical stroke boundaries are not always respected due to the relaxed mood of writing; and the in-strokes and out-strokes allow for a natural transition from one letter to the other. Each is a set of clear letterforms that are easy to write and recognize. The design forms a bridge between handwritten and typographic letters, friendly to both little readers and adults.

Playfair is a transitional design. 
In the European Enlightenment in the late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the popular writing tool of the day.
Together with developments in printing technology, ink, and paper making, it became fashionable to print letterforms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the written letterforms.
This design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any particular design, it takes influence from the designs of John Baskerville and from ‘Scotch Roman’ designs.
</p>
<p>
This typeface was initially published in 2011, and had a major update in 2017.
Being a Display (large size) design in the transitional genre, functionally and stylistically it can accompany Georgia or <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gelasio">Gelasio</a> for body text.
It was succeeded in 2023 by the complete <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair">Playfair</a> design, which as a variable font includes body text designs in the optical size axis.
</p>
<p>
This is the Small Cap sibling family to the main <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display">Playfair Display</a> family. 
The main family downloaded font files include a full set of small caps, common ligatures, and discretionary ligatures.
</p>
<p>
The Playfair project is led by Claus Eggers Sørensen, a type designer based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

<p>Playfair is well suited for general purpose typesetting. Playfair can be interpolated in three dimensions: Width, Weight and Optical Size.</p>

<p>The optical size axis is the most extreme of the axes. Along that axis you can seamlessly change the letterforms from the extremely small Agate (5pt) to the extremely big Needlepoint (1200pt). The Agate has a very low contrast between the thickest and thinnest parts of its strokes, in fact the contrast is even slightly negative, meaning the the horisontal strokes are heavier than the vertical strokes. At the other end the Needlepoint is as high contrast as practically possible. The thinnest strokes are but a single unit wide, meaning that if you were to typeset in 1000 points using a Needlepoint weight, the resulting thinnest strokes would be one point wide. The weight axis adds a second dimension by allowing you to seamlessly change from a light regular to a dark black.</p>

<p>An update in June 2023 slightly modifies the width axis, giving the text a narrower appearance.</p>

<p>In February 2025, a glyphset update improves the language support by adding African.</p>

Play is a minimalistic sans serif typeface designed by Jonas Hecksher during his time as Type Director of <a href="http://www.playtype.com">Playtype Type Foundry</a>. 
All letters in Play derive from the 'O' – square and circular at the same time. 
Play is designed with large, open counters, ample lowercase x-heights and a corporate, yet friendly appearance. 
The combination of these qualities give Play both a high legibility and readability.
</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from the unusual blend of characteristics observed in the Australian platypus, Platypi combines sharp, heavy wedge serifs usually seen in display faces with more conventional curves and proportions to achieve a practical text typeface with a unique and distinctive visual rhythm. The heavier weights push this tension further with increased stroke tapering and overall contrast. Platypi features six weights with matching italic styles. It supports Indigenous Australian and Vietnamese languages, and includes the full Google Fonts Latin Plus Character Set.</p>

<p>The word Platypi is commonly used as the plural of platypus; however, it is a form of pseudo-Latin. The correct plural is platypuses.</p>

<p>Plaster is a very low contrast extremely geometric design done in the tradition of the work of Joseph Albers. However many of the solutions to the glyph design vary from Alber's choices. Plaster is suitable for use in medium to large sizes including headlines. This font deviates from most similar fonts because the space between letters is larger. The gaps in the stencil style letters makes letter identification more difficult. A wider letter space helps make the letters easy to read again.</p>

<p>Pixelify Sans fonts are a unique style of typography that originated in the 1980s with the rise of computer graphics and video games. Pixel fonts are characterized by their blocky, pixelated appearance, which is achieved by using a grid of small, square pixels to create each letterform.</p>

Pinyon Script is a romantic round hand script-style font.
It also features swashes that are confident and showy, somehow giving the type a feeling suggestive of the American West.
Perhaps this is why, despite its refinement and aristocratic style, Pinyon Script manages to feel so friendly.
Pinyon Script uses high stroke contrast and is very slanted, making it most suitable for use at larger sizes.
</p>

<p>
After expanding the glyphset and language support in June 2022, Pinyon Script now supports African Pri, thanks to the 2024 update.

    Phudu is a sans-serif display typeface inspired by Vietnamese hand-lettering billboards in the old days, that
    supports a wide range of languages by Duong Tran. As a new way to achieve variable font, the lighterPhudu gets,
    the extended it becomes, for people to read it easier compared to other lightweight narrow typefaces.
</p>
<p>
    In the progress of learning and crafting types, Duong has always thought about what makes a Vietnamese typeface.
    If we rewind to the past, we can see a Vietnamese lettering style on the billboard stores, when the artists adapted Latin
    typefaces and then added marks based on their styles. Among those, there were mostly all-caps sans-serif types
    played as descriptions or the store's names themself. To make a new easy-to-read and easy-to-get typeface,
    Duong mixed some of the researched letters from the story above. He doesn't want to just revive the types, he wants to
    improve them to fit the modern-day styles, but still have "Vietnamese" souls in them. The typeface was
    named Phudu (phục dựng) - "revival" in Vietnamese, and has a meaning of timeless (quite the opposite of the name
    when it can be read as "phù du" - ephemeral).

<p> Philosopher was started in 2008 and takes inspiration from Agfa Rotis and ITC Binary. This font is universal: It can be used in logos, headlines, and for text. The initial version of the font was deliberately spread with errors - this was my invaluable contribution to type culture around the world, as I thought then - I wanted to stir up designers so they began working <strong>with</strong> fonts, rather than passively using what is there. Over time I wanted to correct the errors, and now the font has been used by millions of people worldwide.</p> <p>In June 2011 a four-style family was published, and in September 2011 the full Latin and Cyrillic family was fully hinted.</p>

Petrona’s personality is an answer to how many characteristics can be added to a typeface without undermining its purpose within the text-type genre.
Petrona playfully maneuvers plenty of personal touches, without losing the essence of a design intended for legibility in digital and print media, from headlines to body text.
Uppercase glyphs have heavy asymmetric serifs and arms with inverted angles, which combine with lowercase designs that share a big x-height, pronounced ascenders, and soft curves of low stroke contrast.
</p>
<p>
First published in Google Fonts in November 2011 as a single style Roman design, it was completely redrawn in 2019 and 2020.
It has evolved, and now offers a comprehensive range of weights, a complete set of corresponding italics, and an extended glyph set that supports over 200 Latin languages.
A full set of small caps, plus ligatures, alternates, and all kinds of numerals, fractions, punctuations, symbols, and currencies are included.
As a variable font, it has a Weight axis in both the roman and italic files.
The previous swashy Q is still available, found in Stylistic Set 1.
It is now a typeface that supplies everything needed for fine text typography.

<p>Formal Scripts are great typefaces to suggest elegance, quality, refinement
and luxury. They are used a lot in print publishing, but you don't see many
formal scripts used on the web. Isn't it? Mostly because their tiny hairlines
breaks and disappear when used at small sizes on the screen.</p>

<p>Also, they usually have long ascenders and descenders, and the lowercase
letters look too small when compared to most sans or serif fonts. More over,
they are usually quite condensed, making them even more difficult to read.</p>

<p>That's why we designed a script type specifically tailored for web use, that
can survive being set even as small as 13px.</p><p>

Pavanam is a Tamil and Latin typeface designed with a focus on greater legibility in smaller sizes for both screen and print media. 
The Latin design is derived from Vernon Adam's <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pontano+Sans">Pontano Sans</a>; 
it has been slightly modified to match with the Tamil typefaces's proportions and vertical metrics.

Lobster is one of the most popular web fonts, designed by Pablo Impallari. 
Pattaya is a version of Lobster extended into Thai, and supports Latin and all variations of the Thai script with an informal loopless design.
However, vertical metrics (that effect line-spacing) had to be adjusted in order to support Thai vowels and tone marks, so this is published as a separate family. 
</p>
<p>
A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ and ฏ, บ and ป, or ข and ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
Pattaya has a specific approach to the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. 
Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. 
Informal loopless Thai tyefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal ones, and this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the character of each glyph.
The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks need to be managed carefully, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.
</p>

<p>Parisienne is a casual connecting script inspired by a 1960s Bra advertisement! It has a slight bounce and intentional irregularity to what might other wise appear to be a more formal script font. Classic, yet free spirited, it is a typestyle for a wide variety of use.</p><p>
    Parastoo is a refined Persian typeface designed by Saber Rastikerdar, developed with modern Farsi usage in both
    print and digital contexts in mind. Rooted in a traditional Naskh-inspired structure, Parastoo features clean lines,
    subtle serifs, and balanced proportions that give it a formal yet approachable appearance. It offers high
    readability and smooth visual flow, with moderate stroke contrast and thoughtful spacing that support long-form
    reading and dense text layouts.
</p>
<p>
    Designed primarily for Farsi, Parastoo ensures accurate rendering and typographic integrity in contemporary
    environments, addressing many of the localization and display issues found in older, legacy Farsi fonts. While it
    draws stylistic influence from classic typefaces such as B Nazanin, Parastoo modernizes the aesthetic and technical
    foundations to better suit today’s multilingual publishing needs. It retains compatibility with other Perso-Arabic
    script languages, making it a versatile choice for professional and editorial use.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that this is a <em>Persian-first</em> font and requires explicitly setting the Arabic language in your
    application to achieve standard Arabic text shaping.

Padauk is a fully capable Unicode 6 font supporting all the Myanmar characters in the standard.
Thus it provides support for minority languages as well, in both local and Burmese rendering styles.
</p>
<p>
Downloads of Padauk include the necessary Graphite smarts to render the Myanmar script correctly.
Thus if you want to use this font at full fidelity to the orthography, you will need to use Graphite-capable applications, such as the latest versions of LibreOffice.
However the web font files served by Google Fonts do not include Graphite tables. 
Fortunately, Padauk also has OpenType tables which allow it to be rendered in a basic way, in applications that support OpenType shaping such as Word. 
The web font files served by Google Fonts include the OpenType tables, so the font will work in most web browsers.

<p>Ovo was inspired by a set of hand lettered caps seen in a 1930's lettering guide. The capitals suggested the time in which they were made because of the soft serif treatment used. This detail and a subtle casual feeling creeping into the otherwise classical forms led to the soft genial lowercase and the whimsical numbers now seen in Ovo. Ovo is a medium contrast serif font. Because of the old style variable letter widths and subtle detail it will work best at medium to large sizes.</p>

<p>This approachable vintage spunk-filled lettering style exudes a casual

It features four weights (light, medium, bold, and black), stylistic alternatives, small caps, and a ton of alternate glyphs. Orbitron was designed so that graphic designers in the future will have some alternative to typefaces like Eurostile or Bank Gothic. If you’ve ever seen a futuristic sci-fi movie, you may have noticed that all other fonts have been lost or destroyed in the apocalypse that led humans to flee earth. Only those very few geometric typefaces have survived to be used on spaceship exteriors, spacestation signage, monopolistic corporate branding, uniforms featuring aerodynamic shoulder pads, etc. Of course Orbitron could also be used on the posters for the movies portraying this inevitable future. It was initially published on the <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com">League of Movable Type</a>.</p>
<p>Orbitron was remastered as a variable font in 2019. To contribute updates or file issues, see <a href="https://github.com/theleagueof/orbitron">https://github.com/theleagueof/orbitron</a>.</p>
<p>
    Orbit is inspired by the concept of monospaced Latin coding fonts. Korean fonts are usually already monospaced, but by bringing the impression of the Latin coding font in the Hangeul and punctuation design, Orbit gives a mathematical and geometric impression through a serif with right angle and orbicular circles. The font attempts to express orbitals with typeface using symmetry and connectivity to create a somewhat cosmic and futuristic atmosphere. As it is reminiscent of coding interface screens, it is recommended to use bright writing on a dark background, below 10pt.

<p>Oranienbaum is a modern high contrast Antiqua with well-defined, recognizable features. Based on the architecture of classic Antiqua fonts, such as Bodoni, Oranienbaum is typical of the typefaces from the first quarter of the 20th century: pronounced serifs, contrasting geometry, and an interplay of right angles and flowing lines. The font is well suited for both headlines and body text.</p>
<p>It was designed through a collaboration of Oleg Pospelov as the main type designer, with Jovanny Lemonad as art director, technical engineer and publisher.</p><p>

<p>From thin to extra bold, Onest is designed as a hybrid of geometric and humanistic grotesques. Onest is suitable for reading long texts from the screens of any device and is recommended for apps and sites. Letters are easily distinguished even in small sizes, so they can be used in interface elements or navigation. Several character sets have been developed for a range of closed and semi-closed apertures, allowing the combination of characters depending on the goal.</p>
    
<p>Onest is a modern typeface, so it has a lot of useful conveniences. The subtleties of correct speech transmission are Onest's strong points. It knows like no other the importance and value of using the right diacritics and the difference between cedilla, ogonek and and the way things should be. For all its versatility, Onest allows text to keep its individuality. All thanks to alternative symbols that set the tone and even the character of the message.</p>

<p>Old Standard reproduces a specific type of Modern (classicist) style of serif typefaces, very commonly used in various editions of the late 19th and early 20th century, but almost completely abandoned later. However, this lettertype still has at least two advantages: <ul><li>it can be considered a good choice for typesetting scientific papers, especially on social and humanitarian sciences, as its specific features are closely associated in people's eyes with old books they learned on;</li> <li>the most beautiful examples of Greek and Cyrillic lettertypes were all based on the classicist style, so for those scripts, "Modern" fonts are much more appropriate than any contemporary (e. g. Times-based) designs.</li></ul></p> <p>The name "Old Standard" was selected as opposed to the "Obyknovennaya Novaya" ("New Standard") typeface, widely used in Soviet typography, which represents another, slightly different type of the same Modern style. Of course this name doesn't look very original, but it seems to be a good choice for a revival of the most common lettertype of the early 20th century.</p><p><strong>Foundry: <a href="http://www.sorkintype.com">Sorkin Type Co</a></strong></p>

<p>Oldenburg is inspired by nearly monoline handwritting seen on a series of German posters. It has been changed and adapted to be more broadly useful design than a more faithful interpretation would have been. Despite the increased ulity in Oldernburg it still presenst plenty of the whimsical feeling that made its source so attractive. Oldenburg can be used a in a wide range of sizes.</p>

<p>Ojuju is a reverse contrast Weight axis variable font inspired by African Masquerades. Ojuju draws inspiration from a variety of African traditional dance costumes to inform the design decisions. The masks worn by the Dogon dancers from Mali inspired the aperture shaping, and counterform placement within many of the letterforms. Additionally African movie poster lettering from the 1970's was referenced to round out the design space. Ojuju covers all of the Google's SSA(sub-saharan-african) latin glyphs.</p>
    
<p>This Afro-grotesque style created by Chisaokwu Joboson, is distinct with varying apertures as it moves from extra-light to bold.</p>

<p>Oi is an ultra-fat display typeface that has its roots in grotesque slab serifs, most specifically the style that sprung with the release of Caslon’s Ionic in 1844 and Clarendon by Fann Street Foundry in 1845. The typeface is a free spirited twisted interpetation of the clarendonesques. With an unapologetic tendency for public shouting, it is a whimsical loudmouth attention seeker!</p>
    
<p>"Oi" is an interjection used in various languages. Its meaning varies, depending on the tone and abruptness of its use, from a simple “hi” or a call of attention to as far as a challenge to a fight.</p>

<p>Noticia Text is a contemporary humanist slab serif typeface designed to be used for running text on digital newspapers (both on websites and mobile apps). It has a large x-height, ample proportions, big serifs and large apertures that allow the letters to be clear, even at small sizes on low resolution screens. The capitals are unusually small, allowing them to be used as substitutes for small caps. (It's recommended to add some tracking if used in this way.)</p> <p>One major feature is the break in the internal curves of round characters. While this break makes some interesting forms at large sizes, their true purpose is to help make the counterforms more open at small sizes by allowing straighter stems. This reasoning is famously known as W.A. Dwiggins' “M-formula.”</p> <p>The italics were designed to contrast with the roman styles while maintaining good legibility. The true italic forms also have big counterforms and simple curves.</p> <p>The fonts have been manually hinted to get the best possible rasterization in Windows.</p> <p>The Noticia font family project is envisioned as 18 different fonts styles, with text, condensed, display and sans variants, different weights and including italic versions, all designed and hinted to work well on computer and mobile devices screens.</p>
<p>Nothing You Could Do is based on the handwriting of a photographer friend. I chose the name because it echoes my love for my husband and children and how my love for them is unconditional and not based on anything they could do or say. I love this handwriting because it is human, it is imperfect, and it is natural.  Real humans don’t write perfectly neatly, and this font creates that feeling of authenticity.</p><p>

<p>&quot;Nobile&quot; is designed to work with the technologies of digital screens and handheld devices without losing the distinctive look more usually found in fonts designed for printing. Going back to William Morris's baseline &quot;Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful&quot;, the aim was to design a font that could function well, have good legibility on screen yet also be good looking, not only at larger display sizes but also right down to small text sizes.</p><p>It's like Chinese food. We take the chicken and mix it with pineapple. For one minute we think that the taste will at least strange, but it is so harmonious and beautiful, what do you know, why didn't you try this earlier? This font is a mixture of neon tubes signage and a typewriter: A thoroughbred mix of chicken and pineapple.</p><p>Niramit is a Thai and Latin family featuring decorative details. The Thai has a modern structure but also features the traditional looped letterforms.</p><p>Nicone is based on the designs of the Stephenson Blake typeface, Madonna, first released in 1925. Madonna itself was based on an earlier face known as 'Bernhard Cursive'. Nicone has been redesigned and shaped to create a new version of the 1925 typeface that can now be used freely as a Libre webfont across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.</p><p>
A Mincho (Japanese Serif) style font which has been drawn on a square grid. It takes inspiration from Mincho's clean and well organized appearance and the organic nature of handwritten letterforms.

News Cycle is a realist, sans-serif typeface based primarily on a revival of the 1908-era News Gothic, the stalwart newspaper face from American Type Founders (ATF).
Like News Gothic, it is designed for clarity and readability in large blocks of copy, but to still look good in headline-sizes at the top of the page.
It also extends News Gothic to better cover more of the world's orthographies, starting with Eastern European and African languages, and soon Greek and Cyrillic alphabets as well.

<p>Neuton is a clean, dark, somewhat Dutch-inspired serif font which reminds you a little of Times. It has a large height, short extenders, and a compact width for better screen use, and economy of space.</p> <p>The family will comprise a regular, italic, and cursive, each in five weights and with smallcaps. Two italics &mdash; one will be called "italic", and the other "cursive" &mdash; are uncommon, but very useful. Ever tried emphasizing something already emphasized? Beyond that obvious example, there are other uses.</p> <p>Sometimes a text needs a different flavor or feel. While one roman can work for a variety of texts, the companion italics don't always. In more classical or personal documents, a stiff, sober, modern and down-to-earth italic will never work. And in many essays, some of the fancier italics look ridiculous. Who said a roman needs only one companion?</p><p>You will throw tomatoes at me when I say that the font Neucha was invented for the sake of one and only one phrase: “I love you”. It was 2005 and I was in love. The first version of the font was done in 8 hours. I recently redid this fastfont from scratch, some glyphs have changed greatly but most of them I did not touch – just polished. Neucha very strong in terms of energy and I love it. Neucha translated from the Russian language means “not knowing how to create fonts right”.</p><p>Nerko is a chunky ‘marker’ effect font. It gives a funky, exciting and modern look while staying smooth and sleek. Be
    as bold as the font while using a friendly style that makes users feel welcome in any circumstances.</p>
<p>From paper to screen, this font was created using traditional Marker Pens on paper for guidance to give it a natural
    feeling.</p>

<p>The letterforms found on the wooden signage at the Rocky Mountain National Park inspired the creation of the National Park. The letters on these wooden trail and directional signs are a system of paths, points, and curves that a router follows. The router’s "bit" follows the path and gives the letters its stroke weight or thickness when engraving a sign. National Park Typeface walks along the path of both honoring the quirky nature of the forms being created by a router bit and optimizing the forms to work in a variety of sizes and languages for print, web, and mobile platforms.</p>

<img src="Image3.png">
<img src="Image4.png">
    
<p>The design of each character begins with a vector skeleton, represented by a series of coordinates that a router would typically interpret and carve into a wooden sign. From there adjustments were made to each skeleton to ensure comfortable legibility at different weights, and we also incorporate optical adjustments where the capabilities of an analog router falls short. The result is a typeface that stays true to its unique inspiration, maintaining its inviting warmth and distinctive character. It can be effectively utilized across a wide range of applications while preserving the essence that makes it truly special.</p>

<p>This project provides a libre and open font family for the Limbu script of Nepal. According to traditional histories the Limbu script was developed by King Sirijonga in the 9th Century. It then fell out of use before being reintroduced in the 18th century by Teongsi Sirijonga (1704-1741) whom many felt to be the reincarnation of the first Sirijonga. The modern Sirijonga was apparently martyred in 1741 for the sake of this script by lamas in Sikkim. The script was named 'Sirijonga' in his honour by the Limbu scholar Iman Singh Chemjong.</p>

Mulish is a minimalist Sans Serif typeface, designed for both display and text typography.
</p>
<p>
It was initially drawn in 2011 by Vernon Adams and then refined until 2014, adding more weights, support for more Latin languages, tightened the spacing and kerning and made many glyph refinements throughout the family – all based on hundreds of users' feedback.
In 2017 the family was updated by Jacques Le Bailly to complete the work started by Vernon after he passed away, in collaboration with his wife Allison, an arist who holds the trademark on the typeface family name.
In August 2019, it was updated with a Variable Font "Weight" axis.

The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure.

The old posters and signs in the traditional <em>Montserrat</em> neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. 
As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. 
The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night!

Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.</p> <p>Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer.

Last year I started converting my typeface designs into fonts. The first was NovaCut and all the Nova family, next MedievalSharp, and here's another...</p><p>
Modak is a sweet plump Devanagari+Latin display typeface with portly curves and thin counters. 
It is Unicode compliant and is open sourced under the SIL Open Font License v1.1.
</p>
<p>
Modak began as a heavy hand-sketched letterform exploration in Devanagari with cute, adorable characters whose curves merged into each other, forming distinct counter shapes. 
As we translated these into a functional font, each character was fine-tuned and multiple matras designed to match precisely with every character. 
Unlike the conventional approach the post-base matras in Modak overlap the consonants. 
Likewise overlapping ukars were also designed leaving thin counters in between. 
Rather than being a mere composite of 2 separate glyphs, every conjunct was redrawn as a single entity. 
The challenge was to maintain legibility and consistency in the thin white counter spaces across all characters irrespective of their structural complexity. 
</p>
<p>
The resulting typeface is one of its kind and most likely the chubbiest Devanagari typeface to be designed so far.
Modak Devanagari is designed by Sarang Kulkarni and Maithili Shingre and Modak Latin by Noopur Datye with support from Girish Dalvi. 
</p>
<p>
We are immensely thankful to Santosh Kshirsagar, Pradnya Naik and Yashodeep Gholap for their suggestions and feedback during the font design process. 
We are also grateful to our friends from the Industrial Design Centre, IIT Bombay and Sir J J Institute of Applied Art for their support and encouragement.

Mitr is a Thai word that means “friend” in Thai. 
Mitr is a sans serif Latin and loopless Thai typeface that combines senses of organic and humanist sans serif designs with rounded terminals. 
It has a wide structure and airy negative space that preserves legibility and readability. 
Mitr is a novel and friendly typeface that is suitable for casual usage such as celebration cards, magazines, and posters.
</p>
<p>
A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, or ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
Mitr has a specific approach to the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. 
Other type designers may consider this font as an example when developing new fonts. 
Informal looped Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal ones, and this allows type designers to extend them to heavier weights. 
The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks have been managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture. 
</p>

First drawn were the inline forms and then they were traced, utilizing a playful 'cutout' effect.</p><p>Mingzat is a Unicode font based on Jason Glavy's JG Lepcha custom-encoded font.

This is due to the popularity of Microgramma, designed by Aldo Novarese and Alessandro Buttiin in 1952, which pioneered the style; and the most famous typeface family of the genre that came 10 years later in Novarese’s Eurostile.</p>

<p>Michroma has character widths and stem weights perfectly formed to fit today's digital screens; Vernon Adams has pioneered a design process with this font that produces excellent results on screen with no manual hinting involved.</p>

<p>The Mai 2023 update features a bigger glyphset and some minor aesthetic modifications.</p>

<p><em>Miama</em> is based on the many handwritten letters of my girlfriend.
Among them are also some ligatures and ornamental glyphs.</p><p>Every single
glyph has been drawn by myself using the free font editor FontForge.</p>
<p>Do not use any condensed nor extended spacing! <em>Miama</em> lives from
connected strokes, which are killed as soon as you change spacing.</p>
<p>Use <em>Miama</em> for main titles, short poems, greeting cards, wedding
stuff et cetera. But please do not consider using it for longer texts,
especially not for scientific texts.</p><p><em>Miama</em> is a very small
typeface compared to other fonts. This is due to the very large ascenders and
descenders. So if you want to look <em>Miama</em> as a font of 10pt, choose
15-20pt. Also keep in mind, that <em>Miama</em> then still looks quite light,
so you want probably resize it even more for titles.</p>

    Menbere is an Ethiopic font with a Latin matched to it. Aleme Tadesse designed Menbere with assistance from Eben
    Sorkin for the Latin. It is publishing by Sorkin Type Co. While contemporary in feeling, Menbere avoids being
    influenced by the Latin script. In the design of Menbere, Aleme judiciously modernizes traditional Ethiopic using
    low-contrast strokes that retain traditional gestures. Due to its multiple weights, and formal style, Menbere is an
    excellent choice for use in corporate design, both in print and on screen as well as UI and wayfinding. Menbere is
    also well suited to mixed script typesetting.
</p>
<p>
    Menbere is named after Alame’s mother. “Menbere” means “seat of
    honor”. Menbere uses different word spaces for texts set in Ge’ez derived languages vs those in Latin for additional
    ease in reading with the Ethiopic script benefiting from a more expansive word space. All Ge’ez script derived
    languages are covered including Amharic, Tigrinya, Tigre, Bilen, and Harari.

<h1><span class="autonym">MATEMASIE</span></h1>
<p>
  Matemasie is an ultra-bold display typeface distinguished by rounded
  edges and top-weighted letterforms. It is inspired by the Adinkra
  symbol "Mate Masie," meaning "what I hear, I keep" — embodying
  the importance of listening and communication in oral
  traditions. The typeface symbolizes the principles of communication,
  wisdom, knowledge, prudence, and connection. 
</p>
<img src="4.png"/>
<p>
The goal of the typeface is a celebration of African heritage while
meeting contemporary design standards. Adinkra symbols express themes
connected to the history, beliefs, and philosophy of the Asante people,
often with proverbial meanings that signify wisdom. These symbols also
describe historical events, human and animal behavior, plant forms,
and object shapes. 
</p>
<p>
Drawing on this Adinkra symbol, the design connects with Africa's rich
graphical heritage. The creation of Matemasie was a journey to craft a
typeface that resonates with the spirit of Africa, drawing deeply from
its roots.
</p>
<p>
The design process involved connecting the past and present,
preserving the essence of African heritage for future
generations. Matemasie celebrates the harmony between tradition and
innovation, reflecting the balance embodied by the "Mate Masie"
symbol.
</p>
<img src="3.gif"/>
<p>
Traditionally, the Mate Masie symbol is represented by four linked
ears—two on top and two on the bottom. This 2-by-2 arrangement is a
fundamental aspect of the symbol, signifying balance and rhythm, when
it is presented in traditional designs. This rhythmic balance played a
crucial role in developing the letterforms of the Matemasie font. 
By integrating this cultural structure into the digital design,
Matemasie stays deeply connected to its cultural roots, preserving the
essence of the symbol while adapting it for contemporary use.
</p>
<p>
The design process aimed to respect and reflect the traditional
symbolism, allowing the modern typeface to serve as both a functional
tool and a cultural tribute. The typeface captures both the artistic
and spiritual essence of "Mate Masie" through its unique typographic
features.
</p>
<p>
Matemasie is more than a collection of letters; it is a testament to
the rich mosaic of African culture and tradition. Like the symbol that inspired it,
Matemasie whispers stories of ancient wisdom and caution through its
elegant curves. It is hoped that Matemasie's story will continue to
evolve with various styles, inspiring typographers to explore the
depths of African culture and wisdom.

   Matangi is a semi-condensed sans-serif variable typeface that supports both Latin and Devanagari scripts. It includes seven static weights — Light, Regular, 
   Medium, Bold, SemiBold, ExtraBold, and Black — offering a flexible range suitable for titles, headings, logos, and small body text. Started as a personal challenge and a love for 
   typography, this project was a journey of exploration and self-learning, designed to offer a flexible, functional tool for multilingual design. It is also the first 
   variable font project from Nepal, with the hope of benefiting users worldwide.
</p>
<p>
   The design is based on simple geometric shapes, primarily squares and circles, giving the letterforms a structured, rational character. Subtle inktraps are applied at stroke
   joints for aesthetic purposes, ensuring even typographic color across various sizes and weights. The x-height of the Latin script and the base character height of the Devanagari
   script are carefully aligned to create visual harmony when typesetting both scripts together. Matangi includes over 1,700 glyphs and provides extensive language support, covering 
   more than 150 (Devanagari &amp; Latin Based) languages, primarily including Nepali, Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi, Awadhi, Dotyali and Latin-based languages. It seamlessly renders 
   extended Sanskrit ligatures and complex Devanagari matras.

<p>Marmelad is designed specifically for medium to large-size headlines and remains well-balanced for long text setting because of its regular proportions and medium contrast. Ascenders and descenders are elegant and details refined. The name and overall feel refers to marmalade sweets - soft and ductile.</p> 
<p>All vertical strokes are rounded towards the baseline, which is why technically there is no sense for overshoots in rounded letters like O. Marmelad performs well on screen because of its soft rounded features and generous x-height.<p> 
<p>The font supports Latin and Cyrillic. In 2022, the kerning is improved and the Latin language coverage expanded.</p>

The letterforms are based on calligraphy and sketches - this is what makes Marko lively, enchanting, and amiable. Marko One typeface will work best in medium to large sizes and captivating headlines. It is technically optimized for better performance on screen, while carefully adjusted outlines promise good quality in print too.</p><p>
This typeface design was inspired by Tim Holloway's Markazi typeface, with his encouragement, and initiated by Gerry Leonidas as a joint University of Reading and Google project.
</p>
<p>
The Arabic glyphs were designed by Borna Izadpanah and design directed by Fiona Ross, they feature a moderate contrast. It takes its cues from the award-winning Markazi typeface, affording a contemporary and highly readable typeface.
</p>
<p>
The complementary Latin glyphs were designed by Florian Runge. It keeps in spirit with its Arabic counterpart, echoing key design characteristics while being rooted in established Latin traditions. It is an open and clear design with a compact stance and an evenly flowing rhythm.

<p>
The family is available in four weights with extended language support suited for print and screen.

    144-point Fraktur while subtly nudging your worldview. A glorious typographic wolf in Pulitzer-winning sheep’s

<p>Mansalva is a script font that works well for notes and informal text passages. It presents two alternates for each letter and number to provide a natural, handwritten, less mechanical look. It also features good legibility for a handwriting typeface and is perfect for a casual-looking annotation.</p> 

<p>Latest upgrade from October 2022 includes a Latin Plus language coverage currently supporting most Latin-based languages. The vertical metrics have been harmonised for a better cross-platform experience; as a result existing users may notice a visible increase of the line spacing in webpages and documents on Mac.</p>

Maitree means &#8220;friendliness&#8221; in Thai. 
Maitree is a serif Latin and looped Thai typeface with wide proportions. 
It is characterized by its bigger-than-usual looped terminal in Thai, and long serifs in Latin, that balance out the whole structure. 
Maitree offers 6 weights, and its asymmetrically curved terminals are well-suited for both formal and casual usage, especially for works that require an antique and historical manner.
</p>
<p>
A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, or ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
Sizes and positions of Thai vowels and tone marks have been managed carefully, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.

The Lobster font took a different approach. 
The new OpenType format gives us the possibility to have multiple versions of each letter, and that's exactly what we are doing: Instead of compromising the design of our letters to force connections, we do what lettering artist do. 
We draw many versions of each letter and a lot of different letter-pairs (aka "ligatures") so we always use the best possible variation of each letter depending of the context of the letter inside each word. 
All this happens automatically in any browser that supports ligatures.
</p><p>Livvic is a custom corporate typeface designed by Jacques Le Bailly for LV=, an insurance company based in the UK. The typeface is part of a brand redesign.</p> 

<p>Livvic was designed to capture LV=’s brand values and uniqueness. It is an open, friendly and somewhat quirky design. Corporate, yet still fresh and personal.</p>

<p>The Roman is an upright Italic, with some inspirations from handwriting. This gives livvic a strong, yet accessible character.</p> 

<p>The Italic has matching metrics to the Roman. Although the Italic and Roman share a lot of similarities, the construction is different. It is gives the Italic some more panache.</p>

  Libre Caslon Text is optimized for web body text (typically set at 16px), whilst the companion family
  <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Caslon+Display">Libre Caslon Display</a> is optimized for web headlines.

<p>
  Libre Caslon Text was specifically tailored to be used for web body text (typically set at 16px). It can be used at very small sizes and will still be readable on your website.
</p>

<p>
  Another big difference is that pretty much all other digital Caslons revivals are based on 18th Century specimens by William Caslon I and William Caslon II. Libre Caslon, instead, is based on hand lettering artist Caslon interpretations typical of 1950s advertising.

<p>Libre Caslon Display is the display version of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Caslon+Text">Libre Caslon Text</a>. The family is optimized for web headlines.</p>

<p>There are already lots of digital Caslon's revivals, and lots of Caslon-esque fonts. Some are very good. But none of them was truly made for the web. While they look very good when printed on paper, they render very small when used for web body text on the screen.</p>

<p>Another big difference is that pretty much all other digital Caslons revivals are based on 18th Century specimens by William Caslon I and William Caslon II. Libre Caslon, instead, is based on hand lettering artist Caslon interpretations typical of 1950s advertising.</p>

<p>Kerning by Igino Marini with iKern.</p>

<p>Libre Caslon Display also include some nice, extra Open Type features (available in the downloadable files), and a big Pro character-set covering 103 Latin languages: Afar, Afrikaans, Albanian, Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarusian, Bislama, Bosnian, Breton, Catalan, Chamorro, Chichewa, Comorian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Faroese, Fijian, Filipino/Tagalog, Finnish, Flemish, French, Gaelic (Irish/Manx/Scottish), Gagauz, German, Gikuyu, Gilbertese/Kiribati, Greenlandic, Guarani, Haitian_Creole, Hawaiian, Hungarian, Icelandic, Igo/Igbo, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Javanese, Kashubian, Kinyarwanda, Kirundi, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luba/Ciluba/Kasai, Luxembourgish, Malagasy, Malay, Maltese, Maori, Marquesan, Marshallese, Moldovan/Moldovian/Romanian, Montenegrin, Nauruan, Ndebele, Norwegian, Oromo, Palauan/Belauan, Polish, Portuguese, Quechua, Romanian, Romansh, Sami, Samoan, Sango, Serbian, Sesotho, Setswana/Sitswana/Tswana, Seychellois_Creole, SiSwati/Swati/Swazi, Silesian, Slovak, Slovenian, Somali, Sorbian, Sotho, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tahitian, Tetum, Tok_Pisin, Tongan, Tsonga, Tswana, Tuareg/Berber, Turkish, Turkmen, Tuvaluan, Uzbek/Usbek, Wallisian, Walloon, Welsh, Xhosa, Yoruba, Zulu.</p><p>The Libre Bodoni fonts are based on the 19th century Morris Fuller Benton's ATF design, but specifically adapted for today's web requirements. They are a perfect choice for everything related to elegance, style, luxury and fashion. Libre Bodoni currently features four styles: Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic.</p>

Libre Baskerville is a web font optimized for body text (typically 16px.)
It is based on the American Type Founder's Baskerville from 1941, but it has a taller x-height, wider counters and a little less contrast, that allow it 
to work well for reading on-screen.

    Lexend fonts are intended to reduce visual stress and so improve reading performance. Initially they were designed with dyslexia and struggling readers in mind, but Bonnie Shaver-Troup, creator of the Lexend project, soon found out that these fonts are
    also great for everyone else.
</p>
<p>
    The first set of Lexend fonts by Thomas Jockin (
    <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Deca">Deca</a>,
    <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Exa">Exa</a>,
    <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Giga">Giga</a>,
    <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Mega">Mega</a>,
    <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Peta">Peta</a>,
    <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Tera">Tera</a>,
    <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Zetta">Zetta</a>) becomes wider and more openly spaced (also known as "tracked out"). This new version of Lexend is a variable font with a weight axis.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the initial release of this font had a lighter Regular weight. It has been decided for the update of July 2021 to align the Regular weight with the one of Lexend Deca which is slightly bolder. Lexend and Lexend Deca are therefore the
    same (for now…). Ultimately this version will offer a HyperExpansion axis which will allow variation of inner and outer space of letterforms.</p>
<p>
    True to Bonnie’s vision, Lexend fonts are freely available for all since 2019 in Google Fonts.

Lemonada is a modern Arabic and Latin typeface family designed by Mohamed Gaber and Eduardo Tunni. 
It started with the Latin design <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lemon">Lemon</a>, which Eduardo Tunni expanded to four weights. The Arabic was designed by Mohamed Gaber.
</p>
<p>
The Arabic design is contemporary, starting with Naskh and introducing influences of Diwani. 
It has wide and open counters that improve readability at smaller text sizes, while its more subtle details make it a great display face at larger sizes.
</p>
<p>
Lemonada is currently available as a variable font with a weight axis, four static fonts (Light, Regular, SemiBold, Bold), and a wide character set that supports the Arabic, Farsi, and Urdu languages.
</p>
<p>
The Lemonada project is led by Mohamed Gaber, a type designer based in Cairo, Egypt. 
To contribute, see <a href="https://github.com/Gue3bara/Lemonada">github.com/Gue3bara/Lemonada</a>
</p>
<p>Lemon  is a display typeface with soft and fluid shapes that come from painted street shop signage. The dark weight is ideal for headlines and short texts, and a future release of a lighter weight could be useful for longer text. The uppercase letters are very carefully drawn, making an attractive and unique design for text in all caps, compound words in capital letters, and acronyms.

<p>Lekton has been designed at ISIA Urbino, Italy, and is inspired by some of the typefaces used on the Olivetti typewriters.</p>

<p>It was designed by: Paolo Mazzetti, Luciano Perondi, Raffaele Flaùto, Elena Papassissa, Emilio Macchia, Michela Povoleri, Tobias Seemiller, Riccardo Lorusso, Sabrina Campagna, Elisa Ansuini, Mariangela Di Pinto, Antonio Cavedoni, Marco Comastri, Luna Castroni, Stefano Faoro, Daniele Capo, and Jan Henrik Arnold.</p>

<p>The typeface has been initially designed at ISIA Urbino by the students Luna Castroni, Stefano Faoro, Emilio Macchia, Elena Papassissa, Michela Povoleri, Tobias Seemiller, and the teacher Luciano Perondi (aka galacticus ineffabilis).</p>

<p>This typeface has been designed in 8 hours, and was inspired by some of the typefaces used on the Olivetti typewriters.</p>

<p>The glyphs are 'trispaced.' It means that the space are modular, 250, 500, 750, this allow a better spacing between characters, but allow also a vertical alignment similar to the one possible with a monospaced font. We were thinking it was a bright new idea, but we discovered that was usual for Olivetti typewriters working with 'Margherita.'</p>

<p>Updated in November 2012: As one of the earlier families published in Google Web Fonts, Lekton lacked proper subsetting, so this update introduces a default 'latin' subset that contains less characters but loads faster. <strong>To use the full character set, update your API link to include the <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started#Subsets">latin-ext subset</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The austere and concise personality and flexibility make it a real multiple-purpose typeface. The letter forms are distinguished by a large x-height, sufficient stroke contrast, robust but elegant wedge-like serifs and terminals. These features have been specially designed to reach maximum of quality and readability when used in unfavorable print and display processes - such as in newspapers, laser printed documents and on low resolution screens. The typeface can be qualified as matched to modern trends of type design and of enhanced legibility. These characteristics provide an undeniable distinction to the typeface, making it suitable for editorial use in newspapers and magazines, corporate ID, advertising and display typography.</p><p>Leckerli is your new fat friend for any display-fun!

Lato means “Summer” in Polish, and it is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic.
Originally conceived as part of a corporate identity for a large client, the family became available for a public release when they decided to go in different stylistic direction. 
</p>
<p>
Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities in the design; 
to create a typeface that seems “transparent” when used in body text but also displays original traits in larger size use. 
Classical proportions, particularly in the uppercase, give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance, and combine with a sleek treatement that feels contemporary without being trendy. 
Semi-rounded details feel warm, while the underlying structure provides stability and seriousness. 
“Serious but friendly, with the feeling of the Summer,” said Łukasz.

<p>Langar is a one-weight Latin/Gurmukhi display font based on informal, playful letterforms. It broadly follows the
    ‘upright-italic’ style of Latin fonts, experimenting with and introducing a similar style for the Gurmukhi script.
</p>
<p>Langar’s harmonised Latin/Gurmukhi design aims to expand the possibilities for both the general user and the
    specialised designer working with bilingual texts by providing a good quality display option. </p>
<p>The design specifically caters to characterful display at larger sizes, providing a contrasting secondary style to
    most text typefaces generally available for Latin/Gurmukhi texts.</p>

Lalezar is an Arabic and Latin display typeface for popular culture.
</p>
<p>
During the 1960s and 1970s a genre of filmmaking emerged in Iran which was commonly known as Film-Farsi. 
The main focus of the films produced in this period was on popular subjects such as romances, musicals and unrealistic heroic characters. 
The movie posters designed to represent these films were also intended to exaggerate these elements by the use of provocative imagery and a particular type of display lettering. 
These bold and dynamic letterforms were so popular and widely used that perhaps one can consider them the most significant component of film posters in that period. 
</p>
<p>
Lalezar is an attempt to revive the appealing qualities in this genre of lettering and transform them into a modern Arabic display typeface and a suitable Latin companion. 
Although the main inspiration comes from a style of lettering that was used to represent the Persian language, here the objective is to design a typeface that can be used for most of the languages that use the Arabic script for their written communication. 
</p>
<p>
The Lalezar project is led by Borna Izadpanah, a type designer based in London, UK.

Laila is an informal sans serif design with brush terminals. 
It has a very contemporary, 21st century appearance. 
Text set in Laila appears friendly, or even cute! 
Laila looks especially good in headlines. 
It is a display typeface, but it may also be used to set shorter passages of text, too.
</p>
<p>
Laila’s Latin component has a high x-height and open counter forms. 
In terms of the thickness of its strokes, everything is mostly monolinear.
The Devanagari component is even more fluid, appearing lively and graceful. 
The height is between the Latin x-height and capital height. 
The strokes thickness is a little lighter than in the Latin; 
in text blocks, texts set in each script will have similar color.
</p>

Hitesh Malaviya designed the Devanagari, and the Latin is by Jonny Pinhorn.

Kumar is a series of matching Open Source display fonts. 
They each support the Gujarati and Latin scripts. 
The two Kumar fonts may be used together, or entirely on their own.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kumar+One+Outline">Kumar One Outline</a> is a vertical-contrast design, in which both the downstrokes as well as the left and right-hand sides of each letterform are built up out of two parallel lines and the whites space in-between them. 
The upstrokes and typeface’s horizontals are just thin, single lines. 
</p>
<p>
Kumar One itself fills in all of the thicker empty spaces in the downstrokes/horizontals, offering letterforms that are very dark and full of contrast. 
</p>
<p>
The Kumar design is made entirely out of straight lines; all elements that would usually be drawn with soft curves are faceted, built up out of several shorter straightened-out elements. 
Text in either Kumar font shimmers like a jewel; the effect of both fonts is quite decorative. 
</p>
<p>
The Gujarati and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the Gujarati base characters are 85% as tall as the Latin uppercase. 
Text set in the Gujarati script sits nicely alongside the Latin lowercase, too. 
Kumar’s Gujarati vowel marks are all single-line, rather than double-line. 
Indeed, Kumar’s Gujarati is a very unique design; there are simply no other options like it currently available!
</p>
<p>
Each of the Kumar fonts has 870 glyphs, including hundreds of unique Gujarati conjuncts. 
The Latin component’s character set is an extended one, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western, Central, and Eastern European languages. 
Parimal Parmar designed Kumar for Indian Type Foundry in 2016.

Kufam is an Arabic-Latin bilingual typeface intended for contemporary information design such as signage and wayfinding systems. 
Kufam Arabic is inspired by 7th-century Kufi inscriptions. 
The dark, condensed shapes of this early Kufi script also served as an inspiration for Kufam's Latin lowercase, as where the Latin capitals find their roots in lettering as frequently seen in signage and shop lettering in Amsterdam at the beginning of the twentieth century. 
All these inspirations from sources in different periods in history of the Arabic and Latin world cumulate in a contemporary, legible and aesthetically rich design for use across different media.
</p>
<p>
Kufam Arabic is designed by Wael Morcos and Kufam Latin by Artur Schmal and originally conceived within the framework of The Khatt Foundations’ Typographic Matchmaking in the City project.

Kiwi Maru was created mainly for use in digital devices, and I hope you will use it experimentally in your papers and reports.
</p>
<p>
The basic vocabulary of the Japanese language is divided into three categories: "everyday words", which are used freely in everyday conversation, articles and novels, "written words", which are used in official situations and sentences, and "slang", which is more informal in style.
</p>
<p>　
Kiwi Maru Regular is a typeface for visualization and sharing of everyday and slang expressions in the digital age. Nowadays, in 2020, Mincho and Gothic typefaces are exclusively used in smart phones, tablets and PC environment. We hope that the introduction of a round font will change the way people express their emotions and feelings, which have been missing from the analog and digital worlds, and the painful feeling of having too many Chinese characters in a font.
</p>
<p>

Khand is a family of compact mono-linear fonts with very open counter forms. Developed for display typography, the family is primarily intended for headline usage. 
Its letterforms are dynamic, and everything is designed according to a modular system. 
All of its shapes bear a strong commonality to one another, but the typeface strikes a good balancing act and avoids too much repetitiveness. 
The lighter styles are suitable for short paragraphs of running text, while the heavier styles have been optimized for headlines or single word settings.
</p>
<p>
The base character height in the Khand fonts is ‘big on the body.’ 
Across a line of text, the consonantal forms take up the majority of vertical space. 
Vowel marks above and below have been shortened – keeping these to a minimum allows for lines of text to be set more closely together vertically. 
The reduction of interlinear space is paramount for successful headline typesetting, and Khand performs much better in display applications than similar fonts with more elongated vowel marks. 
Because of their reduced height, the typeface’s vowel mark forms have been simplified somewhat out of necessity, but this stylistic reduction is in-keeping with the modular feeling of the typeface’s overall design. 
Dot-shaped marks appear rounded in order to help maintain their differentiation from other marks.
</p>
<p>
Khand’s Devanagari component was designed by Sanchit Sawaria and Jyotish Sonowal. 
The Latin component was designed by Satya Rajpurohit.

<p>Inspired by travel and my stay in Kenya, I would fill my days with sketches and lettering. From there Kenia evolved as a stencil display font. With its text appearance in small point sizes resembling an old German gothic sort of font, modern-feel Kenia works for headlines, introductory paragraphs, and in small text setting.

It can also work well in larger point size text blocks. Its unusual shapes provide an interesting rhythm to the textline, a distinctive, rectangular design that can give a sporty, urban feeling.</p><p>Keania is a re-development of 
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Kenia">Kenia</a>. As a 
stencil font its idea stems from experiences of travel and life in Kenya, 
especially from the large lettering seen on shop fronts and market stands.</p>

<p>The shapes play with sharp and soft corners and create a rhythmic pattern
of black and white. This font is great for magazine headings, adverts and
sporty content.</p>

Kavivanar is a unique handwriting font that supports the Tamil and Latin scripts.
It is somewhat bold, and slightly slanted, a typical Tamil handwriting style where an incline is popular.
The letterforms show a calligraphic pen stress that brings an aliveliness to the letters, and provides texture in body text settings. 
It works well with both body text and display text because of the intriguing rhythm.
</p>
<p>
The slanted letterforms for Tamil are inspired from a manuscript by Kavivanar M. A. Azeez (1948-2002), a Tamil poet and educator who lived in the east coast of Sri Lanka.

The angles of the vertical strokes vary a little, and the positioning along the baseline jumps around, giving it a more rustic and natural feeling.
</p>
<p>
Most script fonts have long ascenders and descenders, and this means they look too small when used at normal sizes on the web.
This font is optimized in such details to be very readable as a web font, even when used as small as 16 px.

Katibeh is a headline font based on the Naskh script, infused with some qualities of the Thuluth script.
The small serif-like outstrokes make Katibeh remind us of archaic designs, but other aspects of the design are very contemporary touches.
The result is something between tradition and today.
Katibeh has ligatures that Arabic and Persian readers are familiar with, to make it comfortable for reading longer texts.
Unlike many other Arabic fonts, Katibeh includes a Latin typeface designed for harmony with the Arabic to make it useful for multilingual texts.
</p>
<p>
The Latin is scaled to work best with the Arabic component. 
</p>
<p>
The Katibeh project is led by KB Studio, a design studio in Los Angeles.

</p><p>Karma is an Open Source multi-script typeface supporting both the Devanagari and the Latin script. The family was developed for use in body text on screen, and five fonts are available. The characters for both scripts feature a construction style that tends toward the monolinear. The Latin script component has serif letters. Both these, and the stroke terminals in the Devanagari letterforms are generally rounded in Karma’s design.</p>

<p>Karma’s characters are economic in width, and the Latin sports a tall x-height. Although the knotted terminals in the Devanagari letterforms are closed, the general feeling of the Devanagari character set is open and airy. See the design of the ख (kha), छ (cha) and ध (dha), for example.</p>

Kanit means mathematics in Thai, and the Kanit typeface family is a formal Loopless Thai and Sans Latin design.
It is a combination of concepts, mixing a Humanist Sans Serif motif with the curves of Capsulated Geometric styles that makes it suitable for various uses, contemporary and futuristic.
A notable detail is that the stroke terminals have flat angles, which allows the design to enjoy decreased spacing between letters while preserving readability and legibility at smaller point sizes.
</p>
<p>
In Thai typeface design the formal loopless Thai typefaces have more simple forms than the conservative looped Thai designs, and this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the essential character of each letter. 
Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures.
When designing Kanit, special care was taken with some groups of letters such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, and ข ช to ensure they are distinct and legible, because it might lead to confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.
</p>
<p>
Kanit is the first Thai font family to be hinted with <a href="http://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/">TTFAutohint</a>, an easy-to-use hinting tool that is highly recommended.
</p>

<p>The Kirat Rai script is used to write the Bantawa language in the Sikkim state of India. Kanchenjunga is the first Unicode font family for this script of South Asia and The Kirat Rai script was officially encoded in the Unicode Standard version 16.0. The font is named after the third highest mountain in the world, located on the border between Sikkim state in northeast India and eastern Nepal. This peak represents the geographical distribution of the Bantawa language.</p>

<p>The design of the font is loosely based on the handwriting style of Kirat Rai which was used in some of the early reading primers for Kirat Rai. Kirat Rai script is also called “Khambu Rai Lipi” in West Bengal.</p>

<h3>Step into the World of Color.</h3>
<h4>A new gradient variable font to take the most out of the COLRv1 format</h4>
<p>
  Kalnia Glaze is a new typeface commissioned by Google Fonts, that experiments
  with the new color font technology in variable fonts, inviting you to step
  into a world of color and add vibrancy and depth to your projects.
</p>
<img src="Kalnia-Glaze-FridaMedrano-01_Cover.png" />
<p>
  Kalnia Glaze is the result of an broad exploration of the latest COLRv1 format
  and it's integration with the variable font technology. The objective was not
  only to create a complex layered design to explore the possibilities of the
  format but also to streamline and expedite the process, minimizing the need
  for manual adjustments through software and emphasizing the automation of
  processes using paintcompiler, a program by Simon Cozens.
</p>
<img src="Kalnia-Glaze-FridaMedrano-02_Cards.png" />
<p>
  COLRv1 is the latest version of the color font format combining transparency,
  gradients, and variable font technology. As one of the advantages of the
  format, it's possible to change the color palettes in code. Kalnia Glaze is
  designed for both light and dark modes color palettes, with easily accessible
  palettes through CSS. CSS also offers easy and powerful customization options
  using the "override-colors" property
</p>

<p>
  This font uses the COLRv1 and CPAL tables. Please visit 
  <a href="https://googlefonts.github.io/gf-guide/color.html">the gf-guide color page</a>
  to learn more about Color Fonts technology.
</p>

<p>
  Kalnia Glaze also has four main icons with the option of using them solo or
  with a frame.

Kalnia is a variable font with weight and width axes designed with high contrast and refined terminals, drawing inspiration from the Victorian era. This historical period marked a transition from manual to machine production, and the 'fat face' style emerged—a bold and attention-grabbing typography used for poster headlines to stand out from traditional typefaces.
Kalnia embodies the delicate and the boldness, bridging the gap between the old and the new. This display font family comprises a total of eight styles, making it a versatile choice for poster headlines and expressive design projects.

Kalam is a handwriting-style typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts.
This is an Open Source font family first published by the Indian Type Foundry in 2014.
</p>
<p>
Even though Kalam's letterforms derive from handwriting, the fonts have each been optimised for text on screen.
All in all, the typeface is a design that feels very personal.
Like many informal handwriting-style fonts, it appears rather fresh and new when seen on screen or printed on the page.
Kalam's letterforms feature a very steep slant from the top right to the bottom left.
They are similar to letters used in everyday handwriting, and look like they might have been written with either a thin felt-tip pen, or a ball-point pen.
In the Devanagari letterforms, the knotted-terminals are open, but some other counter forms are closed.
Features like these strengthen the feeling that text set in this typeface has been written very quickly, in a rapid manner.
</p>
<p>
Kalam is available in three weights: Light, Regular and Bold.
Each font contains 1,025 glyphs, which includes many unique Devanagari conjuncts.
These ensure full support for the major languages written with the Devanagari script.
The Latin component's character set is a basic western one, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages.
Lipi Raval and Jonny Pinhorn developed the family for ITF; Raval designed the Devanagari component while she and Pinhorn worked together on the Latin.
</p>

Kaisei Tokumin is a shorten word for Tokudai Mincho Kana, meaning "Extra Bold Serif Kana," intended for the strong title usage. Extra bold typefaces sometimes become unbalanced when having heavier density in the glyph, and loses the breathe of words. Kaisei Tokumin is designed to keep the legibility and still have power as an extra bold typeface.

Kadwa is a Devanagari typeface family designed by Sol Matas. 
It is based on the original Latin typeface <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Bitter">Bitter</a>, a slab serif typeface for text.
</p>

<p>
People read and interact with text on screens more and more each day. 
What happens on screen ends up being more important than what comes out of the printer. 
With the accelerating popularity of electronic books, type designers are working hard to seek out the ideal designs for reading on screen.
</p>

<p>
Motivated by Sol's love for the pixel she designed Bitter, and later Kadwa.
A "contemporary" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on any computer or device. 
The robust design started from the austerity of the pixel grid, based on rational rather than emotional principles. 
It combines the large x-heights and legibility of the humanistic tradition with subtle characteristics in the characters that inject a certain rhythm to flowing texts.
</p>

<p>
It has little variation in stroke weight and the Regular is darker than a typical typeface intended for use in print.
This generates an intense color in paragraphs, accentuated by the serifs that are as thick as strokes, with square terminals.
</p>

<p>
Each glyph is carefully designed with an excellent curve quality added to the first stage of the design, that was entirely made in a pixel grid. 
The typeface is balanced and manually spaced to use very few kerning pairs, especially important for web font use since most browsers do not currently support this feature.
</p>

<p>Kablammo is an experimental variable font, taking inspiration from maximalist curly doodad designs from the ’90s, the Memphis Design movement, as well as cartoons and toys from those eras.</p>

<p>Kablammo has one variable axis, Morph(MORF), which makes the glyphs dance. The decorative elements fly all over the place, along with shifting weight and contrast. This lends itself particularly well to animations.</p>

<p>Each glyph has four primary states that be morphed between, and can be considered the most stable and considered forms. Each of these are accessible as instances (styles) in font menus that properly support variable fonts. This offers a quick alternative for accessing the alternate forms, and can be handy if you don’t need all the variety, and in-between states of the full variable font.</p>

<p>Kablammo was designed by <a href='https://www.vectrotype.com'>Vectro Type Foundry</a> and released in 2023.</p>

<p>K2D is a Thai and Latin family which has a modern appearance but features Thai's traditional looped letterforms.</p><p>Just Me Again Down Here was created a few weeks after my family and I moved to China, using a Wacom Tablet and Adobe Illustrator.</p> <p>This is my “messy” handwriting with mixed capitals and irregularities.   After moving to China and finding myself without the ability to communicate in my new home country’s language, creating a font was something that reminded me that I did know how to do <em>something</em> and I would survive those first confusing weeks abroad.</p><p>Jura is a family of sans-serif fonts in the Eurostile vein. It was originally inspired by some work I was doing for the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/">FreeFont</a> project in designing a Kayah Li range for FreeMono. 
The Latin alphabet is using the same kinds of strokes and curves as the Kayah Li glyphs, and thus Jura was born. It has been expanded to include glyphs for the Cyrillic and Greek alphabets as well.</p> 
<p>The original Kayah Li glyphs have been included in this font. Note that glyphs for writing mainstream Burmese are not and never have been a part of this font.</p> 
<p>The Jura family has an unfortunate name clash with Ed Merritt’s Jura serif font. To contribute, see <a href="https://github.com/ossobuffo/jura">github.com/ossobuffo/jura</a>.</p>
<p>Junge is an elegant and slim text typeface inspired by the calligraphy of Günther Junge. Thanks to a combination of features it performs equally well in most ranges. At small sizes it builds the impression of flittering strokes. In large headlines its refined detailing become visible. It is not as strictly structured as a text typeface, and has subtle irregularities reminiscent of its calligraphic origin. Junge is designed by Alexei Vanyashin (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/avanyashin">@avanyashin</a>)</p><p>
Julius Sans One is a sans serif typeface family from Chilean type foundry <a href="http://www.latinotype.com">LatinoType</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Updated, April 2015:</b> 
hinting was applied (with ttfautohint) and the non-breaking space glyph was adjusted to be the same width as space.
</p><p>The peculiarity of this typography lies in its curved structures and strokes, which are developed on it by getting thinner and sharper as if they were being typed using a metallic and bevel-edged point.</p> <p>The visual mark characteristic of Julee is a casual cursive-like type, yet balanced due to the tidy proportions of its signs.</p> 

<p>The March 2023 update features a bigger glyphset, fractions and some minor aesthetic modifications.</p>

Judson is a serif font designed for African literacy. 
It contains as many glyphs and precomposed combinations that I know of for all African languages written in Latin-derived alphabets. 
It uses OpenType tables for correct placement of diacritical marks, including stacked marks. 
Care has been taken so that all characters are easily distinguished, even in the italic face. 
The medium roman face has support for the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA.)
</p>

<p>
Currently Judson is only available in medium roman, italic and bold roman faces; at this time there is no bold italic.

<p>Jua is a Korean and Latin font</p>
<p>I enjoyed designing this typeface because it was inspired by my little son
"Jonah," who is called by his friends "Joti." The type has the informality and
style of the cartoons which children watch. Its primary concept is top-heavy
stems with a slight sense of movement to further enhance the style. Joti is
ideal for composing headlines and short texts in sizes larger than 14
points.</p>

<p>Josefin Slab was the first typeface–at least in my mind–I designed! But I decided to start simple with Josefin Sans. Following the 1930s trend for geometric typefaces, it just came to me that something between Kabel and Memphis with modern details will look great.</p> <p>I wanted to stick to the idea of Scandinavian style, so I put a lot of attention to the diacritics, especially to "æ" which has loops connecting in a continuous way, so the "e" slope was determined by this character.</p> <p>It also has some typewriter style attributes, because I've liked the Letter Gothic typeface since I was in high school, and that's why I decided to make a Slab version of Josefin Sans.</p><p>
The idea of this typeface is to be geometric, elegant, with a vintage feeling, for use at larger sizes.
It is inspired by geometric sans serif designs from the 1920s.
The x-height is half way from baseline to cap height, an unusual proportion.
</p>
<p>
There is a sister family, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Slab">Josefin Slab</a>

<p>Jomolhari is a free, Unicode compatible, Tibetan script font named after Mt Jomolhari on the border of Bhutan and Tibet. This font can be used for Tibetan and Dzongkha text.  It was inspired by Bhutanese manuscript examples and was originally designed for use in publishing traditional Buddhist texts.</p>
<p>
Jomhuria is a dark Persian/Arabic and Latin display typeface, suitable for headline and other display usage.
</p>
<p>
The name means 'republic,' and the spark of inspiration for the design was a stencil of “Shablon” showing just a limited character set just for the Persian language without any marks, vowels or Latin glyphs.
Shablon was designed 30 years ago in Iran, and is reinterpreted by Kourosh to incorporate contemporary techniques, aesthetics and of course some personal taste.
While inspired by the spirit of Shablon, Jomhuria is a new typeface that stands on its own.
The typeface designer Kourosh created an additional original Latin design that is tailored to harmonize with the aesthetics of the Persian/Arabic design.
</p>
<p>
Being made for big sizes means details matter.
The positions of the dots remains faithful to their locations in Persian/Arabic calligraphy;
this is an important factor of beauty in the writing system and is key to readability.
</p>
<p>
The Arabic script was designed by Kourosh Beigpour, and the Latin was designed by Eben Sorkin.
The font is engineered by Lasse Fister, and the technicalities build upon those developed by Khaled Hosny for his “Amiri.”
</p>
<p>
The Latin is scaled to work best with the Arabic component. 
</p>
<p>
The Jomhuria project is led by KB Studio, a type design foundry based in Los Angelese, USA.

Jaldi is the Hindi word for soon, and the typeface family is a contemporary sans-serif Devanagari with subtle rounded corners. 
Designed by Nicolas Silva and Pablo Cosgaya, Jaldi is developed to match with the Latin design of the <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Asap">Asap family</a>, named after the acronym "As Soon As Possible."
</p>

<p>
This family is specially developed for screen reading and use as a webfont, and like Asap is has a special twist: 
Jaldi offers a standardised character width on all styles, which means that lines of text always remain the same length.
This useful feature allows users to change type styles on-the-go without reflowing text bodies. 
</p>

<p>
Asap is based on Ancha, designed by Pablo Cosgaya and Hector Gatti in collaboration with Andres Torresi.
This project is led by Omnibus Type, a type foundry based in Argentina.

 Jaini Purva and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jaini+Purva">Jaini</a> (both Devanagari) are typefaces based on the calligraphic style of the Jain Kalpasutra manuscripts, particularly referencing a manuscript from 1503 CE.
 The manuscript style has several unique features not seen in the commonly observed Balbodh style.
 These include a disconnected shirorekha with triangular wedges, short upper matras, squarish letters with large kana height, heavy knots, and the integration of lower matras within the kana height.
 It also contains some letter-shapes that have evolved over time and are not familiar to current readers.
 In an attempt to revive the distinct calligraphic style for contemporary use, Jaini adapts visual features of the manuscript style to contemporary letter-structures.
 Jaini and Jaini Purva differ in their treatment of conjuncts; Jaini adheres to contemporary conventions of horizontal conjuncts, whereas Jaini Purva stays true to vertically stacked conjuncts as seen in manuscripts.
</p>
<p>
 While Jaini Devanagari references past manuscripts, its Latin companion draws inspiration from a hand-lettering style seen in present-day India.
 In regions where Devanagari is predominantly used, it is not uncommon to see Latin letterforms drawn with a Devanagari pen angle (which is almost perpendicular to the Latin pen angle) with a subtle hint of a shirorekha.
 Jaini (Latin) draws inspiration from this street style while visually matching it with the wavy stems and squarish counters of Jaini Devanagari.
</p>
<p>
 Jaini Devanagari was designed in 2016 by Girish Dalvi and Maithili Shingre.
 Jaini Latin was designed in 2023 by Taresh Vohra.
 This project is led by Ek Type, a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces.

Francois</a> font.</p>

<p>Jacques Francois revives the c. 1760 Enschedé no. 811 type specimen by Jacques
François Rosart (1714-1774), made for Enschedé Printing House. The concept was
to create a contemporary webfont with an even typographic color while
preserving the essential historic peculiarities and expanding the character
set. Compared to the historic specimen the x-height is generously increased
and contrast lowered.</p>

<p>Jacques Francois Shadow is designed for large sizes and manually instructed
for better screen performance starting from 24 ppem. This means that on Window
machines it will work best from 18pt (at 96ppi) or 15pt (at 120ppi) and from
24pt on Mac (at 72ppi.)</p>

 Jacquard is an expanded revival typeface from a Victorian needlepoint alphabet designed in Berlin by Heinrich Kuehn circa 1880.
</p>
<p>
 Designing typefaces for knitting is essentially the same as creating pixel types.
 However, in practice, the pixel size is determined by the properties of the yarn in use.
 Scale is determined by the weight of the yarn as well as the number of pixels that make up the height of each letter.
 In this collection, the number following the typeface's name indicates the height of the capital letters for that typeface.
</p>
<p>
 These typefaces were designed with machine knitting in mind, but could be used for hand knitting, needlework, bedazzling, or many other textile crafts.
</p>
<p>
 Note: For Fair Isle knitting, you need to beware of floats and plan accordingly, as always.

basic letters were based on specially modified METAFONT sources from the CM
Bright font family from the TeX community. (METAFONT is very flexible
technology.) But in fact Istok fonts are now very far from this origin.
Contours of the font are designed in the freely distributable font editor, 
<a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net">FontForge</a>.</p>

<p>Most glyphs are manually hinted with the aim to be rendered on LCD
displays. I used <a href="http://xgridfit.sourceforge.net">xgridfit</a> as a
tool for programming truetype instructions. Less frequently utilized symbols
have automatic instructions produced by FontForge autohinting, until manual
hinting can be done. Manual and automatic instructions are intended to look
homogeneous.</p>

<p>The original sources and truetype fonts are available at 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/istok/">code.google.com/p/istok</a> and 
this 'Web' version has modified vertical metrics.</p>

    Introducing Intel One Mono, an expressive monospaced font family that’s built with clarity, legibility, and the
    needs of developers in mind.
</p>
<p>
    Identifying the typographically underserved low-vision developer audience, Frere-Jones Type designed the Intel One
    Mono typeface in partnership with the Intel Brand Team and VMLY&amp;R, for maximum legibility to address developers'
    fatigue and eyestrain and reduce coding errors. A panel of low-vision and legally blind developers provided feedback
    at each stage of design.
</p>
<p>
    Intel One Mono also covers a wide range of over 200 languages using the Latin script. The Intel One Mono fonts are
    provided in four weights — Light, Regular, Medium, and Bold — with matching italics, and we are happy to share both
    an official release of fonts ready to use as well as editable sources.

<p>Instrument Sans is a font designed for the <a href="https://www.instrument.com">Instrument</a> brand. It's a variable sans-serif which balances an abundance of precision with subtle notes of playfulness. Inspiration was drawn from our enduring interest in neo-grotesques. In a way, this family of weights, widths, and italics represent an orchestration of all of our favorite qualities in a sans-serif while featuring contemporary characteristics that make this typeface distinctly our own.</p>
    
<p>Featuring 12 unique stylistic sets, commonly-used characters can be replaced with alternate glyphs in a variety of combinations to tailor the appearance and legibility of messaging. This flexibility allows for a wide range of expressive styles, making it easy to mold it to perfectly suit whatever style of expression is needed.</p>

»Inknut Antiqua« is an Antiqua typeface for literature and long-form text.
Approaching the idea of web-publishing as a modern day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_press" target="_blank">private press</a>, it is designed to evoke Venetian incunabula and humanist manuscripts, but with the quirks and idiosyncrasies of the kinds of typefaces you find in this artisanal tradition.
</p>

<p>
It comes with a complement of typographical sorts and OpenType features for the purpose. 
The proportions of Inknut Antiqua make it well suited for low-resolution screens.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminalia_chebula" target="_blank">Inknut (Terminalia Chebula),</a> called »harad« in Hindi, is a nut-like fruit that can be used for ink making and is purported to cure blindness. 
The tree it grows from is native to the Indian sub-continent and south-east Asia.
</p>

<p>
The Inknut Antiqua project is led by Claus Eggers Sørensen, a type designer based in Amsterdam.

<p>Inspired by Easter Island and its Rapa Nui language and culture, this typeface captures the essence of an island located in Chile, South America, full of mystery, sacred places and stories of the past. “Inika” means “ink” in the Rapa Nui language, and it represents the tradition of the rongo-rongo writing, used by people on the island thousands of years ago. The tiki style was worked into the characters with a light touch while developing the upper and lowercase letters forms to evoke the spirit of the island. Inika is useful for both long text setting, document titles, and even large display sizes.</p><p>
Ingrid Darling is a cute script font originally created for greeting cards. It is based on a cursive hand writing style that has a playful, whimsical appeal. It would be best served as a display font and should be used sparingly rather than in larger bodies of type.

There are a great many &#8220;programmer fonts,&#8221; designed primarily for use on the screen, but in most cases do not have the attention to detail for high resolution rendering.
</p>
<p>
Inconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources. 
I was particularly struck by the beauty of Luc(as) de Groot's Consolas, which is his monospaced design for Microsoft's Vista release. 
This font, similar to his earlier TheSansMono, demonstrated clearly to me that monospaced fonts do not have to suck.
</p>
<p>
The development of the Regular style by Raph Levien was started in 2006 using his own Spiro-based tools and FontForge.
The Bold style was designed by Kirill Tkachev and the Cyreal foundry in 2012.

<p>Imprima looks excellent even on cheap home printers because it has broad counters, strong joins between stems and inktraps that enable it to perform well in very small sizes. Professionally printed documents will make it look even better, especially in large sizes, because there the details of its design that are distinctive become clearly visible. The design of this typeface family is cared for as one cares for your own family. Each component has been treated humanely, by hand.</p>

<p>The February 2023 update features a bigger glyphset, fractions and some minor aesthetic modifications.</p>

<p>STANLEY MORISON, in his “THE ROMAN ITALIC & BLACK LETTER bequeathed to the University of Oxford by Dr. JOHN FELL” (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1951), began this way the description of the FELL TYPES: &quot;The Oxford Printing house holds the oldest punches and matrices surviving in England, material not only treasured but used; types cast therefrom being employed for the composition of books and other printed matter.&quot;</p><p>It’s essentially the inheritance of the will of John Fell, D.D. who died on 10 July 1686, aged 61, Bishop of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church. Since 1668 he spent his life creating a ‘learned press’ in Oxford, endowed with invaluable equipment, setting a high standard for the future of his publishing.<p> He wrote: &quot;The foundation of all successe must be layd in doing things well, and I am sure that will not be don with English letters&quot; (to Jenkins, 2 Dec. 1672). So he collectected types available in the foreign market: mainly France, Holland and Germany. Fell decided to develop types in its own ‘workhouse’ too.</p><p>Peter De Walpergen became his personal type-founder. Says Harry Carter in “THE FELL TYPES. What has been done in and about them” (Oxford University Press, New York, 1968): &quot;He was born at Frankfurt am Main, descended from a Protestant refugee from Antwerp. He was engaged by the Dutch East India Company in 1671 to work as a type-founder and printer in Java. The comparative crudity of his letter design makes it seems unlikely that he had been trained to cut punches.&quot;</p><p>John Fell entrusted him with the cut of the larger bodies: Great Primer Roman and Italic; Double Pica Roman and Italic; French Canon Roman and Italic; Three Lines Pica Roman. De Walpergen cut other types and letters for existing types to be harmonized with the larger bodies. Commented Morison: &quot;The design of these large Fell Types is difficult to characterize and impossible wholly to approve. It has some affinity with the Dutch work of the second half of the seventeenth century, especially with the bigger size of type shown in the Widow Elsevier’s specimen-sheet of types attributed to Christoffel van Dyck; but De Walpergen went much further in the contrasting weight of thick and thin strokes and his design has crudities about it of which Van Dyck would not have been capable.&quot;</p><p>In 1686 John Fell died. In his “will” he bequeathed the entire collection of type to the University of Oxford. Remembers Morison: &quot;This entire collection of ‘founding Materialls of Punchions Matrices Moulds’ was ‘got together’ by John Fell ‘and others at great expense’.

<em>Imbue</em> is a variable condensed didone made for your special occasion. The result is something crisp and curvy with two variable axes: weight and optical size.

<p>The idea of geometric typefaces with a look reminiscent of the machinery, technology, and interior design of the 1950s originated in Eurostile family by Aldo Novarese and Alessandro Butti (1952).</p> <p>Iceland is a modular square-shaped webfont by Victor Kharyk with a cold brutal character designed with the intention to perform well on screen starting from low resolutions. For this purpose the strokes are deliberatly kept vertical and diagonal cuts have a 45° angle, outlines are rounded.</p> <p>Features like wide proportions and generous x-height are introduced for better legibility. Unconventional and simplified letterforms like k, f, r aid readability at small sizes. While at display sizes they add a crisp and sharp impression.</p> <p>Uppercase letters are decently heavier compared to lowercase as a tribute to the old typographic tradition. This way uppercase is easily distinguished from lowercase, and allows scaling down to be used as Small Caps.</p> <p>Because of its ascetic modular character and squarish proportions Iceland webfont is easily integrated in modular grids and logotypes.</p><p>Iceberg is a slim condensed decorative webfont by Victor Kharyk suitable for medium to large sizes. It is monolinear and mostly monospaced, has long ascenders and descenders, and a modular construction that builds a rhythm. These features improve overall readability. Its monolinear strokes and 45 degree cuts echo letters made from folded tape.</p><p>

</p><p>In 2007, The Calcografía Nacional Española organized a project directed by José María Ribagorda with the objective of divulging the invaluable typographic heritage produced in Spain in the 18th century through the "Imprenta Real".</p>
<p>This project included the recovery of the types designed by Geronimo Gil for the edition of the most beautiful "Quixote" never edited, printed by Joaquín Ibarra for the “Real Academia de la Lengua” in 1780. This font was called “Ibarra Real”.</p>
<p>José María Ribagorda decided in 2015 that Octavio Pardo would be the first collaborator to play the design. Octavio was the first student of the University of Reading MA Typeface Design program to study this project.</p>
<p>The Ornaments made by celebrated Latin American and Spanish designers would not be included until their authors allow them to be distributed under the SIL Open Source License.</p>

    Iansui is based on Fontworks' <a href="https://github.com/fontworks-fonts/Klee">Klee Semibold font</a>, which is a script font handwritten by pencil or pen. Its quiet design has an elegant and slightly feminine look that sets itself apart from traditional script and textbook fonts. Ideal for body text. Iansui further modifies the existing design to meet the Ministry of Education's requirements for Taiwanese use.

    Host Grotesk is a uniwidth sans serif variable font tailored by Element Type for modern user interfaces. It features uniform letter widths and spacing across all weights and corresponding italics, ensuring seamless adaptability without compromising layout consistency.

<h2>A uniwidth typeface</h2>
<img src="HostGrotesk-image-4.png" />
<p>
    As a uniwidth typeface, Host Grotesk allows for smooth transitions between font weights without disrupting overall design and layouts. For instance, a button's size remains constant even when the font weight increases during a hover state. Similarly, making a part of a sentence bolder will not push the letters to the next line.
</p>
<img src="HostGrotesk-image-2.png" />
<p>
    Calibrated for both display and text applications, Host Grotesk has low contrast stroke modulation and closed terminals that complement the straightforward construction of its letterforms, making it an excellent choice for digital media. The proportions are balanced between a generous geometric sans and a compact grotesque, suitable for both display sizes and small body copy.
</p>
<img src="HostGrotesk-image-5.png" />
<p>
    The Host Grotesk family is built on Jonny Pinhorn's beloved Poppins (Indian Type Foundry, 2020). While most letters are reworked and modified for the new look and duplexed proportions, Poppins' soft and approachable essence remains visible. A reliable and cohesive type family for user interfaces, branding, and communication materials, combining the contemporary workhorse category with the elevated functionality of uni-width proportions.

Loud, bright, and exuberantly fun! Honk is a variable colour font from Ek Type. It is a riotous digital interpretation of the bold and boisterous lettering seen on Indian trucks.
</p>
<p>
An extravaganza of form and colour, Honk is a modular system with ten distinct styles, shadows, and colour palettes. An embodiment of India's colourful complexity, it effortlessly oscillates between simple and subtle to over-the-top and ornate. It's the kind of font that doesn't just speak; it shouts, honks, and sings with its varied styles, dynamic shape-shifting and use of colorv1 technology.
</p>
<p>
Honk reflects the essence of India's vibrant spirit, and it does so with an audacious flair. So, the next time you need a font that's as lively as an Indian street corner, give Honk a try. It is a typographic adventure you won't forget!
</p>
<p>
This project is designed, engineered and maintained by Ek Type; a collective of type designers focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. Honk is designed by Noopur Datye and Yesha Goshar, and engineered by Sidharth Jaishankar and Girish Dalvi, emojis are designed by Athul Jayaraman and testing is done by Taresh Vohra and team Ek Type. A big honk to all the amazing designers who helped by open sourcing their color/element-based variable fonts.
</p>

<p>
    This font uses the COLRv1 and CPAL tables. Please visit

<p>Homenaje is inspired by the bronze cemetery art found in the Recoleta and
Chacaritas districts of Buenos Aires, Argentina. A grotesque and narrow type,
it provides economy in text setting without losing its strong, straight and
steady features. The name “Homenaje” means tribute in Spanish, a modest way to
honor the patient and accurate work of the lettering artists whose bronze
letters honor a lifetime.</p>

<p>Designed by Constanza Artigas Preller and Agustina Mingote.</p><p>
 Holtwood is a bold display font developed for use with modern web browsers.
 It has a lot of the look of some traditional woodblock poster typefaces of the Nineteenth Century but updated for the Twenty First.

Hind Vadodara is a family of five Gujarati fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
Hind Multi-Script is a type system providing nine stylistically-matching font families – one for each of the following writing systems used in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka: Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Sinhala. 
In addition to Gujarati, the Hind Vadodara fonts also include Latin-script characters.
</p>
<p>
Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. 
This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. 
Additionally, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures and counterforms. 
The entire family feels very legible when used to set text.
</p>
<p>
The Gujarati and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the height of the Gujarati base characters is more or less at the same visual height that the Latin capital letters share. 
The exact height of the Gujarati characters increases vis à vis the capital height as the family increases in weight, just as the Latin lowercase does. 
Each font in the Hind Vadodara family has 851 glyphs, which include many unique Gujarati conjuncts. 
These ensure full support for the writing of the Gujarati language. 
The Latin component’s character set is Adobe Latin 3, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages. 
</p>
<p>
Hind Vadodara is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. 
Hitesh Malaviya designed Hind Vadodara for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015. 
Hind Vadodara is named after Vadodara, a city in Gujarat, India.
</p>

The exact height of the Bengali headline increases vis à vis the capital height as the family increases in weight, just as the Latin lowercase does. 
Each font in the Hind Siliguri family has 820 glyphs, including many unique Bengali conjuncts. 
These ensure support for the languages written with the Bengali script. 
The Latin component’s character set is Adobe Latin 3, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages.

In addition to Kannada, the Hind Mysuru fonts also include Latin-script characters.
</p>
<p>
Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal.

Hind Mysuru’s Kannada and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that multi-script texts will sits nicely alongside each other. 
Since Hind Mysuru’s Kannada characters are monolinear, they have a nice, fresh feeling, and appear very modern.
</p>
<p>
Aside from the Latin glyphs, each of the five Hind Mysuru fonts has 444 Kannada glyphs, including many unique conjuncts. 
These ensure full support for the writing of the Kannada language. 
The Latin script’s character set is Adobe Latin 3, enabling the typesetting of English and other Western European languages.

Hind Madurai is a family of five Tamil fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
In addition to Tamil, the Hind Madurai fonts also include Latin-script characters.
</p>
<p>
Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. 
This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. 
Additionally, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures and counterforms. 
The entire family feels very legible when used to set text.
</p>
<p>
The Tamil and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the head of the Tamil characters falls just below the Latin capital-height. 
Depending in the font weight, Tamil letters appear to be about 80–85% of the height of the Latin uppercase. 
Text set in the Tamil script sits nicely alongside the Latin’s lowercase, too. 
Although Hind Madurai is a “monolinear sans” face, much of its design features tends toward the traditional end of the design spectrum.
Each font in the Hind Madurai family has 552 glyphs, which includes all of the characters needed to write Tamil. 
The Latin character set is Adobe Latin 3, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages.

Hind Kochi is a family of five Malayalam fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
Hind Multi-Script is a type system providing nine stylistically-matching font families – one for each of the following writing systems used in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka: Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Sinhala. 
In addition to Malayalam, the Hind Kochi fonts also include Latin-script characters.
</p>
<p>
Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. 
This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. 
Additionally, Hind’s letterforms feature both open apertures and very open counterforms. 
The entire family feels very legible when used to set text. 
Hind Kochi’s Malayalam and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that multi-script texts will sit nicely alongside each other.

But the specific design features added to Hind Kochi’s Malayalam features give text set in that language a nice, fresh feeling, with a very modern appearance.

<p>
Each font in the Hind Kochi family has 530 glyphs, which includes all of the characters needed to write Malayalam. 
The Latin character set is Adobe Latin 3, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages. 
Hind Kochi is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. 
Dhruvi Tolia designed Hind Kochi for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015. 
Hind Kochi is named after Kochi, a city in Kerala, India.

Hind Jalandhar is a family of five Gurmukhi fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
Hind Multi-Script is a type system providing nine stylistically-matching font families – one for each of the following writing systems used in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka: Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Sinhala. 
In addition to Gurmukhi, the Hind Jalandhar fonts also include Latin-script characters.
</p>
<p>
Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind Jalandhar’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes (quite a common feature in Gurmukhi typefaces.) 
Most strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. 
This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. 
Additionally, Hind Jalandhar’s letterforms feature open apertures and counterforms. 
The entire family feels very legible when used to set text.
</p>
<p>
The Gurmukhi and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the Gurmukhi headline is more or less at the same visual height as the Latin capital letters share. 
The exact height of the Gurmukhi headline increases vis à vis the capital height as the family increases in weight, just as the Latin lowercase does. 
Hind Jalandhar’s Gurmukhi vowel marks take forms that tends toward the traditional end of the design spectrum, while the knotted terminals, etc. inside of the base characters feature a treatment that appears more contemporary.
Each font in the Hind Jalandhar family has 475 glyphs, which includes all of the characters needed to write the Punjabi languages. 
The fonts’ Latin character set is Adobe Latin 3, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages.

Hind is an Open Source typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. 
Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, the Hind font family includes five styles. 
Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, which is paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. 
This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. 
In addition to this, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures. 
The entire typeface family feels very legible when used to set text.
</p>
<p>
The Devanagari and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the Devanagari headline falls just below the Latin capital-height. 
In other words, the Devanagari base characters are 94% as tall as the Latin uppercase. 
Text set in the Devanagari script sits nicely alongside the Latin lowercase, too. 
Hind’s Devanagari vowel marks take forms that tends toward the traditional end of the design spectrum, while the knotted terminals inside of the base characters feature a treatment that appears more contemporary.
</p>
<p>
Each font in the Hind family has 1146 glyphs, which include hundreds of unique Devanagari conjuncts. 
These ensure full support for the major languages written with the Devanagari script. 
The Latin component’s character set is a basic western one, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages. 
Hind is a solid choice for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding.

<p>Hi Melody is a Korean and Latin font.</p><p>The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection is an intriguing reminder of the heady days of hand lettering and calligraphy in the United States. From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.</p> <p>Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein.</p><p>Hermeneus is a grecian style font, inspired by the works of Jim Parkinson
and Ortiz Lopez. It condensation lets you put more characters into a line of
text giving your paragraphs more efficiency. It is intended to be read at small
size text, but also works on large headers and titles.</p>

<p>Henny Penny is an offbeat display font with loads of personality, named in honour of the fairy-tale character chicken Henny Penny. It is a friendly and playful decorative typeface. Its classical nature is successfully hidden behind its very informal structure: There is no common baseline, no common character size and no common slope of the letters. This makes the typeface very amusing. HennyPenny is a headline typeface for use in large size fonts. It may be used for childrens books, magazines and websites.</p> <p>Designed by <a href="https://profiles.google.com/olga.umpeleva/about">Olga Umpeleva</a> for Brownfox.

The Hebrew was drawn by Oded Ezer and the font files were mastered by Meir Sadan.</p>

<p>Since the Hebrew design of this family is primary, the vertical metrics are different to the original Roboto family. This family is auto-hinted, whereas Roboto is hand-hinted, so the rendering quality of Roboto may be better on older Windows machines.</p>

<p>In May 2020, the family has been updated to a variable font family.</p>
    
<p>The November 2023 update fixed some Hebrew bugs and improve the langage support.</p>

<p>Hedvig is a digital insurance company that is challenging the traditional insurance industry by providing a predictable insurance experience.</p>

<p>The Hedvig typeface family was created by Kanon Foundry in collaboration with Hedvig’s in-house design department. The typface reflects Hedvig’s brand philosophy “Stuff happens” – embracing all the things that happen in life, without worry or fear.</p>

<p>
    The typeface family Hedvig Letters consists of two fonts:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Hedvig Letters Serif is designed to balance punchy and honest copy with responsibility and comfort.</li>
            <li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hedvig+Letters+Sans"></a>Hedvig Letters Sans</a> takes the role of the work-horse typeface in Hedvig’s visual toolbox.</li>
        </ul>
</p>

<p>The concept for the typeface was developed by approaching a “non-type-designer” point of view. Optical corrections are usually applied to a typeface to fool the eye that certain shapes are balanced or aligned, when in reality they are not. For this typeface, the imperfections were embraced instead of corrected. The result is a typeface where some letters have a slightly odd, yet characteristic look that effectively communicates Hedvig’s brand and design philosophy.</p>

<p>Headland One is a text typeface designed to be highly legible and comfortable
when reading screens. Headland One is useful from very small sizes to headlines.
Headland One's personality recalls the geniality of the UK private press
movement types made at the turn of the 20th century. Headland One's eccentric
details contribute to the distinctive feeling of the type at smaller sizes but
do not become obvious until the type becomes much larger.</p>

<p>Handlee is loosely based on the handwriting of typographer Joe Prince. Its inconsistent curves give it a nice, human-like quality that is reflected in the characters. Each glyph is stationed at a different position in respect to the baseline, and ascenders and descenders vary, which all contribute to the human-like qualities of the font.</p> <p>Handlee is a great font for any web page looking to add some personality and charisma. There was careful attention to detail in removing unnecessary overlap between letters, which allows Handlee to be scaled down to very small sizes while still maintaining legibility.</p> <p>The diaritics were purposefully designed at a slightly larger scale than normal to add to the ability to be scaled down. Also, the accents on the accented characters were not automatically generated but were rather hand placed individually to portray asymmetry and inconsistency that is typically found in handwriting.</p> <p>All of the little details and careful considerations in Handlee make it the perfect font for any project.</p><p>
Handjet is an element-based variable font (aka pixel font, modular font, …) where every glyph is composed using multiple copies of the same element.
Each element can take one of 23 shapes and transition smoothly between them while creating various effects.
The font currently supports these scripts: Arabic, Armenian, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, and Latin.
</p>

<p> 
Due to rendering issues specific to Mac OS, the font may show aberrations and visual artifacts, resulting in an unusual appearance.

    Hahmlet is inspired by a poster for the Korean ‘Hamlet’ movie from the 1940’s, created by an unknown letterer. The distinct and sharp, quirky and attention seeking details inspired Minjoo Ham to use it for a rather uncommon revival project and turn it into a robust, contemporary typeface. Once the Hangeul was finished, Mark Frömberg took on the challenge to translate the characteristics to the Latin design. A lively exploration into the possible and impossible began. Hahmlet is great for any kind of typesetting, print or screen but also a perfect eyecatcher for signage and poster designs. We highly recommend to use it for Hangeul and Latin bilingual typography.

    Gulzar is a contemporary Urdu Nasta’liq typeface – and its Latin counterpart – designed and developed through a collaboration by Borna Izadpanah (Principal Designer and Project Leader), Simon Cozens (Font Engineering), Alice Savoie (Designer, Gulzar Latin), Fiona Ross (Consultant, Gulzar Urdu), Amir Mahdi Moslehi (Calligraphic adviser, Gulzar Urdu) and Martin Dodds (Consultant, Gulzar Urdu). This typeface was designed to provide an effective textual communication tool primarily for Urdu readers on digital platforms and in print. In Gulzar, the aim has been to produce a typeface which is legible at text sizes and suitable for sustained reading. The first phase of this project involved conducting research into the history of Urdu digital typefaces from the early 1980s. The design of Gulzar was inspired by carefully collected specimens of Urdu calligraphy and lettering which were closely studied to achieve an accurate representation of the Urdu flavour of the Nasta’liq style.
</p>
<p>
    Once the Nasta’liq design was firmly established, a proposal was made for a Latin counterpart that took inspiration from two eminent humanistic references: the versatile and sturdy proportions of Robert Granjon’s types, coupled with the sharp and distinctive feel of Hendrik van den Keere’s work. The Latin letterforms thus feature some subtle references to their calligraphic roots and echo the contrast present in the Nasta’liq, while remaining embedded in their classical typographic proportions.
</p>
<p>
    Gulzar is not the first OpenType Nasta’liq typeface, but it is the first Nasta’liq type for which an original Latin counterpart was designed. It covers all the required transliterations characters to transcribe Arabic, Persian and Urdu languages.
</p>

<p>Gravitas One is modeled on the "UK fat face" which is a kind of very heavy
advertising type created during the industrial revolution in England. The
letter forms are characterized by an attention getting and strong contrast
between the very heavy vertical shapes and the thin horizontal ones. The
contrast of the design means that it will be most useful when set from medium
to large sizes.</p>

<p>Based on Frederic Goudy’s Kennerley Oldstyle. A few words on why I think Kennerley Oldstyle is beautiful: In making this font, I discovered that Kennerley fits together tightly and evenly with almost no kerning. Thus the following words from Monotype specimen books are just: “[W]hen composed into words the characters appear to lock into one another with a closeness common in early types, but not so often seen in later-day creations.” These are letters that take command of the space around them; notice, for instance, the bowed shapes of the v and w.</p><p>
Rotund curves, large loops and voluminous counters. Gotu reimagines Devanagari calligraphy while at the same time reinterprets what high contrast Latin typefaces can be. Though the Devanagari is penned with a traditional canted nib, the structures are improvised with an expressive whim that belies conventions of structure and challenges notions of consistency. Swooping calligraphic strokes inspire forms that are lyrical without being too opulent. The same spirit resonates within a modulated sans serif style Latin as letters retain a calligraphic stress and keep the delicate typographic quirks. Furnished with such typographic subtleties, Gotu can lend its distinct style to a quaint monograph, a striking headline, an ornate invite or even a chic brand.

<!-- Section 1: Short description -->
<h3>Introducing Google Sans Code</h3>
<p>
  Google Sans Code is a fixed-width, geometric sans-serif typeface developed to complement Google's
  corporate branding fonts. Derived from our other brand fonts, this typeface has been crafted
  specifically for writing and reading code, and enhanced for clarity at text dimensions typically
  used in programming interfaces.
</p>
<video autoplay muted loop src="01_Section_1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<!-- Section 2: History and design details -->

<h3>History and design details</h3>
<p>
  The architecture of Google Sans Code merges geometric precision with calligraphic expression
  within the constraints of a fixed-width canvas. The Roman variant builds on a clean, structured
  sans-serif foundation, ensuring optimal readability in code and data-intensive environments. In
  contrast, the Italic variant draws inspiration from early Italian italics, providing a distinctive
  and expressive complementary style. This thoughtful pairing delivers a unique combination of
  technical precision, historical elegance, and personable quirkiness.
</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="02_Section_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<!-- Section 3: Readability & legibility at small sizes -->

<h3>Readability & legibility at small sizes</h3>
<p>
  The fundamental structure of shapes in the Roman design maximizes counter space in letterforms by
  employing gradual curve radii and straight vertical stem segments in predominantly circular
  letters, enhancing clarity at target sizes.
</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="03_Section_3a.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>
  Characters with idiosyncratic features like 'a', 'g', and 'Q' incorporate elements from
  traditional text typefaces to improve recognition in situations where conventional sans serif
  forms might be confused with similar characters.
</p>
<video autoplay muted loop src="04_Section_3b.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<p>
  Symbols frequently used as lexical elements in programming languages have been refined for
  immediate recognition and to maintain an equal visual balance with alphanumerical components
  within the syntactical hierarchy at intended sizes.
</p>
<video autoplay muted loop src="05_Section_3c.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<!-- Section 4: Expressive italics -->

<h3>Expressive italics</h3>
<p>
  The italic style, commonly employed for code comments in syntax highlighting schemes, features a
  more dynamic and contrasting appearance compared to the Roman. This approach parallels Latin
  handwritten manuscripts where authors' annotations appeared in an italic hand, distinguishing them
  from the primary text set in Roman style, establishing a visual hierarchy throughout the document.
</p>
<p>
  The letterforms draw inspiration from Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi's pioneering italic
  typefaces.
</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="06_Section_4.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<!-- Section 5: Auxiliary characters and language support -->

<h3>Auxiliary characters and language support</h3>
<p>
  The character set encompasses support for contemporary programming languages with extensions into
  box-drawing characters and geometric symbols. Google Sans Code also accommodates a comprehensive
  range of human languages that utilize the Latin writing system.

<p>Glegoo, a truly modern slab serif. It has a precise balance of shapes, counterforms and strokes. Glegoo is slightly condensed, has a large x-height, short ascenders/descenders and large counterforms. These attributes all add up to help reading text, even in very small sizes. Its careful design and proper choice of weight generate a nice texture in paragraphs of text, but the design is also intended to work well when composing headlines with presence and elegance. Large usage will show off the delicate modulation of strokes that are in this font.</p>

<p><b>Updated August 2014:</b> A Bold style was added, the family was hinted with ttfautohint, and a Devanagari subset was included.</p>

It attempts to collect, synthesize, and lovingly evoke the identity and spirit of the region in which the original forms were encountered, while acknowledging my own relationship to and presence in the place and the design.</p>

</p>The primary characteristics that define Girassol include its condensed proportions, moderate contrast following the expansion model, a thorny, decorative serif construction that pierces the baseline and cap height, and playful flourishes that mimic the decoration possible in hand-painted signage.</p>

</p>Numerous discretionary ligatures play on the typeface's angular and thorny construction to evoke a sense of improvisation in the signs on which the forms are based.</p>

</p>The smallcaps are the result of my effort to capture the secondary style found in the Carcavelos signs. My approach to the smallcaps lead to a set of letters that perfectly complements the main caps but which simultaneously becomes softer and more gentle because of its more square proportion.</p>

</p>Girassol feels at home set in large, striking titles and smaller graphical vignettes.</p>

The design of new Greek typefaces always followed the growing needs of the Classical Studies in the major European Universities. Furthermore, by the end of the 19th century bibliology had become an established section of Historical Studies, and, as John Bowman commented, the prevailing attitude was that Greek types should adhere to a lost idealized, yet undefined, greekness of yore. Especially in Great Britain this tendency remained unchallenged in the first decades of the 20th century, both by Richard Proctor, curator of the incunabula section in the British Museum Library and his successor Victor Scholderer. In 1927, Scholderer, on behalf of the Society for the Promotion of Greek Studies, got involved in choosing and consulting the design and production of a Greek type called New Hellenic cut by the Lanston Monotype Corporation. He chose the revival of a round, and almost monoline type which had first appeared in 1492 in the edition of Macrobius, ascribable to the printing shop of Giovanni Rosso (Joannes Rubeus) in Venice. New Hellenic was the only successful typeface in Great Britain after the introduction of Porson Greek well over a century before. The type, since to 1930’s, was also well received in Greece, albeit with a different design for Ξ and Ω. GFS digitized the typeface (1993-1994) funded by the Athens Archeological Society with the addition of a new set of epigraphical symbols. Later (2000) more weights were added (italic, bold and bold italic) as well as a latin version.<p>
Under the influence of the neoclassical ideals of the late 18th century, the famous French typecutter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmin_Didot">Firmin Didot</a> in Paris designed a new Greek typeface (1805) which was immediately used in the publishing programme of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamantios_Korais">Adamantios Korais</a>, the prominent intellectual figure of the Greek diaspora and leading scholar of the Greek Enligntment.
The typeface eventually arrived in Greece, with the field press which came with Didot’s grandson Ambroise Firmin Didot, during the Greek Revolution in 1821.
</p>
<p>
Since then the typeface enjoyed an unrivaled success as the type of choice for almost every kind of publication, until the last decades of the 20th century.
Didot’s type was the base for a new font, GFS Didot (1994), which was designed by Takis Katsoulidis, and digitised by George Matthiopoulos, of the <a href="https://www.greekfontsociety-gfs.gr">Greek Font Society</a>.
The typeface is accompanied by a matching Latin design, inspired by Hermann Zapf’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatino">Palatino</a>.

<p>I was shown squared-off lettering on a record label and asked to draw something similar. Geo, the result, was substantially completed within four hours in July 1999. It’s a simple geometric typeface in the mould of some of the experimental faces designed during the 1920s by well-known modernist designers such as Theo van Doesberg and Herbert Bayer.</p> <p>This style found a strong echo in designs of Neville Brody in the 1980s, which are now identified as an expression of the consumer culture of that decade. During the 1990s the magazine and font catalogue Emigre was at the public front of typeface design, and was a place where computer fonts with this same look appeared.</p> <p>I think Geo expresses both the directness of some of the 1920s faces and the rather disingenuous consumerist thrust of the 1980s and 1990s descendants of theirs.</p><p>Gentium Plus is the new version of the two reduced character set families, Gentium Basic and Gentium Book Basic.

</p><p>Gelasio is an original typeface that is metrics compatible with Georgia in its Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic weights. Its design was inspired by an original printed sample of a French Transitional typeface which follows the Romain Du Roi typeface introduced in 1702.</p>

<p>As a transitional type, it is marked by an interest in rational planning and it has a tension between rigor and expression. It feels generally formal and rational but its rounded terminals make it more contemporary and friendly. It also offers an occasional flourish, especially in the italics.</p>

<p>The June 2022 update offers an major language support update.</p>

<p>In March 2024, the glyph set for GF Africa Pri has been enhanced with improved diacritics, along with the addition of some other basic language support from the 'Beyond' glyph set. Updates were also made to currency symbols, other symbols, spaces, and NSM localization.</p>

    When people mention "Soek" in South Korea, they will think of the Chinese character. This word gives the impression of being as thick and hard as a stone. Ga means "to add" in Korean. So this typeface, Gasoek, is a much thicker typeface than usual typefaces. The thick strokes fill up the embox, but by giving the right angle at the end of stroke to match with Hangeul characteristics, the font has natural counter spaces with good legibility. So, Gasoek is not just a thick font but a font that has a character and gives a unique impression.

<p>Gabarito is a light-hearted geometric sans typeface with 6 weights ranging from Regular to Black originally designed for an online learning platform in Brazil.</p>

<p>Named after the Brazilian Portuguese work for an answer sheet, Gabarito was made to help young people learn and overcome the university entry exams known as "vestibular", and it did that by packing lots of high-school level symbols and figures into a very friendly voice that was equal parts functional and engaging.</p>

<p>The initial design was comissioned in 2017, started by Leandro Assis and Álvaro Franca, it then got developed and improved further in 2020 by Álvaro Franca and Felipe Casaprima, and finally in 2023 it got a little bit of a makeover in order for it's debut in the commons, that last part with a lot of help from Henrique Beier of Harbor Type.</p>

<p>Fugaz One is a sans serif with very geometric features and gestural characteristics, which brings it away from its formal beginnings. Combined with its italic inclination, Fugaz One has become a very dynamic font.</p><p>
Fruktur initially appears to be a playful and powerful black letter type with a warm friendly feeling. 
However its construction is closer to that of an upright italic. 
Fruktur offers some of the feeling of a black letter but with higher legibility and greater utility than is typical of black letter type. 
Fruktur will be most useful from medium to large sizes.

    Fraunces is a display, "Old Style" soft-serif typeface inspired by the mannerisms of early 20th century typefaces such as <a href="http://fontreviewjournal.com/windsor/">Windsor</a>, Souvenir, and the Cooper Series. Fraunces was designed by Phaedra
    Charles and Flavia Zimbardi, partners at <a href="http://www.undercase.xyz">Undercase Type</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Fraunces is a Variable Font with four axes: Weight (wght), Optical Size (opsz), Softness (SOFT), and Wonky (WONK). The Softness axis controls the “wetness” or “inkiness” of the typeface. The Wonky axis controls the manual substitution of “wonky” characters,
    such as the lean of the h, n, and m glyphs in the Roman, and the flagged ball terminals of the b, d, h, k, l, v, and w glyphs of the Italic.

</p><p>Frank Ruhl Libre is an open source version of the classic Hebrew typeface Frank Rühl, the most ubiquitous Hebrew typeface in print. Frank Rühl was designed in 1908 by Rafael Frank in collaboration with Auto Rühl of the C. F. Rühl foundry of Leipzig. A final version was released in 1910. Many Israeli books, newspapers and magazines use Frank Rühl as their main body text typeface.</p>

<p>Made to accommodate the growing need for typefaces in secular Hebrew writings, the typeface was fitted to modern printing demands and designed to be readable in longform text, with and without vowel marks. Frank Rühl has Sephardi proportions (mem-height is approximately 4½ stroke widths), and is based roughly on Venetian typefaces used by printer Daniel Bomberg. Frank wrote of his design that he wishes to combine the simpleness of Antiqua with the "pleasantness" of Fraktur, leading him to "quieten" the letterforms by reducing the contrast between its thin and thick strokes.</p>

<p>This newly designed revival by Yanek Iontef is a family of 7 weights, Light to Black (the original typeface had only one) and in November 2022, it became variable and offers a larger choice of weights.</p>

    <code>-&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code> or <code>:=</code> are single logical tokens, even if they take two or three
    characters on the screen. Your eye spends a non-zero amount of energy to scan, parse and join multiple characters
    into a single logical one. Ideally, all programming languages should be designed with full-fledged Unicode symbols
    for operators, but that’s not the case yet.

    Fira Code is an extension of the Fira Mono font containing a set of ligatures for common programming multi-character
    combinations. This is just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This helps to read
    and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like <code>..</code> or <code>//</code>, ligatures allow us
    to correct spacing.

<p>Fenix is a serif typeface designed for use in both display and long text.
Very inspired by calligraphy, it has strong serifs and rough strokes. Its
proportions are designed to gain space savings in text, both in height and
width. It is elegant at large sizes and legible at the same time, with a lot
of rhythm in small sizes.</p><p>Felipa is a carefully written calligraphic font based on a traditional Italian chancery cursive, though reinterpreted with a contemporary feeling.</p><p>Federo is a display webfont that references Jakob Erbar's Feder Grotesk. The goal was to keep the typeface as close as possible to the original 1909 design while adapting it for crisp web typography. Details were refined and contrast was slightly reduced for consistency. Figures obtained regular proportions and counters were increased for better legibility.</p> <p>Designed by Olexa Volochay in 2011.</p><p>
Federant revives the Reklameschrift typeface Feder Antiqua by Otto Ludwig Nägele (1911). 
The main challenge of designing a modern interpretation was to balance between applying visual corrections for overall consistency and staying close to the original source. 
In certain cases the historical authenticy was sacrificed in favour of an even typographic color.
</p>
<p>
This project required research of historic type specimens in search for the missing letterforms. 
The unusual interpretation of the Yen currency symbol can be found in typefaces of that period.

    Exile is a display stencil font inspired by music and iconic logo of The Rolling Stones.
</p>
<p>
    The author saw it as a great challenge to design custom fonts for bands as a personal project. Their idea was to
    create a stencil typeface due to its practicality. It needed to be bold and loud, without compromising on
    design &emdash; making an all-caps approach essential. The contrast between swashy, soft, tongue-like elements and
    sharp, heavy slab serifs gave it the unique look the author envisioned. Its name was inspired by one of the author’s
    favorite Rolling Stones albums, <em>Exile on Main St</em>.

It began with letterform sketches made by hand with a copperplate nib, which were redrawn digitally with the stroke endings of a brush script. This makes the type seem playful, which is important in casual scripts.</p> <p>It has very fast curves, thanks to the slight slant angle, but it remains highly legible.

<p>Esteban is a typeface intended to be used in texts, specially literature and poetry. Its a serif font with medium contrast, tall x height, medium compression, and robust serifs. It offers personality, readability and economy.</p> <p>One of the most important features of Esteban is its stroke, that loses or gains weight in the stems. This feature was defined from the manuscripts of Jorge Alfredo Díaz Esteban, a writer who used a tool that can generate modulated strokes. This means the stroke width varies due to the pressure of the pen on the paper, and this quality allows the font to have a presence on the page that makes texts more dynamic. The precise level of contrast was decided by experimenting with various 'colors' of density that emerge in text settings. This allows Esteban to achieve good performance even in medium and low quality prints and as a web font.</p><p>Erica is a voluptuous contemporary tribute to the sans serif work of Eric Gill that is mixed with the painter Botero.</p><p>Epunda Slab is the perfect companion of Epunda Sans. The sturdy, angled serifs give the font a robust and traditional look. Epundas Sans is a variable font with a weight axis that ranges from Light (300) to Black (900).</p>

Elsie is inspired by feminine energy. 
This new typeface was created to celebrate the world of women, glamour and fashion. 
It combines the strength of Bodoni with the softness of italics. 
Sensitive, attractive, full of personality, innovative and subtle with both classic and new design features.
I aimed to add expressive features to the letters, providing nuances that make this a unique vision of Bodoni type. 
It provides an option to the type which readers often encounter.
</p>
<p>
The font was developed by Alejandro Inler in conjunction with Ana Sanfelippo.
</p>
<p>
There are two Elsie families, a <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Elsie">Regular</a> family and this Swash Caps family, each with a regular weight and a black weight suitable for large display usage.

El Messiri is a modern Arabic typeface family designed by Mohamed Gaber (Arabic) that began with Jovanny Lemonad's Latin and Cyrillic typeface <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Philosopher">Philosopher</a>. 
The Arabic started with the concept of a curvy Arabic typeface inspired by the beauty of Naskh and drawn as if with a brush instead of the traditional bamboo pen. 
The idea took form with wide counters that improve readability at smaller text sizes, and has subtle details that make it a great display face at larger sizes. 
El Messiri current comes in 4 weights (Light, Regular, SemiBold and Bold) and the Arabic component has a wide glyph set that supports the Arabic, Farsi and Urdu languages.
</p>
<p>
The font has been upgraded to a variable font with a weight axis (Regular to Bold) in August 2021.

<p>Lettering in a Russian commuter train inspired designer Valery Zaveryaev to create the Electrolize typeface with an accurate techno character. It came out solid enought to work well in any size from body copy to headlines.</p> <p>Electrolize can be best described as a squarish geometric typeface with humanistic proportions. It has an accurate techno character, holds the baseline well because of its rectangular modular-based construction. At display sizes its detailing in terminals become noticeable.</p> <p>It is optimized for screen, and will work well in print thank to its simple and straight outlines.</p><p>

<p>The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Edu">Foundation Fonts for Australian Schools collection</a> is a set of handwriting fonts designed specifically to meet Australian Education standards. While weights, widths and optical sizes were carefully crafted to work well in an Australian classroom environment, they are just as comfortable to read and work with in the home environment.</p>
    
<p>Each Australian state teaches different handwriting styles in lower primary school (although some states do share the same style). There are essentially three stages involved with each state's styles:
    <ol>
        <li>The foundational stage involves learning basic letter formation.</li>
        <li>The transitional stage adds joining ligatures to some letters.</li>
        <li>The cursive stage joins almost all letters (with some exceptions).</li>
    </ol>

    Eczar started as a student project in 2010–11 during Vaibhav Singh’s MA studies in Typeface Design at the University
    of
    Reading. Eczar was designed to bring liveliness and vigor to multi-script typesetting in Latin and Devanagari – with
    the intention of providing an alternative to existing designs by imparting a strong mix of personality and
    performance, both at text sizes and in display settings. The family offers a wide expressive range and the display
    qualities of the design intensify with corresponding increase in weight, making the heaviest weights best suited for
    headlines and display purposes.

</p><p>Economica is the first digital typeface created in Montevideo, Uruguay, to be distributed internationally. The development of the typeface took most of 2007 and received the assistance of type design colleagues from all over Latin America.</p> <p>Economica has four basic styles: Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic. It includes a comprehensive character set that lets you work with diverse European languages.</p> <p>This typeface family was designed for the output of inkjet printers. It was inspired by the concept of saving space in publishing texts without loss of height. This means it is a very condensed type.</p> <p>The visual advantage of Economica is that accomplishes this horizontal compression while keeping a strong personality. It is not a typical, neutral, sans serif. The open forms and tendency towards flattened curves allow it to be used in very small spaces while retaining high legibility.</p> <p>To contribute to the project contact <a href="mailto:produccion.taller@gmail.com">Vicente Lamónaca</a>.</p><p>
EB Garamond is intended to be an excellent, classical, Garamond.
It is a community project to create a revival of Claude Garamont’s famous humanist typefaces from the mid-16th century.
This digital version reproduces the original design by Claude Garamont closely: 
The source for the letterforms is a scan of a specimen known as the “Berner specimen,” which was composed in 1592 by Conrad Berner, the son-in-law of Christian Egenolff and his successor at the Egenolff print office.
This specimen shows Garamont’s roman and Granjon’s italic types at different sizes.
Hence the name of this project: Egenolff-Berner Garamond.
</p>
<p>
Why another Garamond?
That typeface is a key moment in the history of typography, and European type designers have been reacting to this work ever since.
It is probably the most revived typeface in the world and many are excellent.
In the world of free/libre culture, however, only a few Garamond-inspired types exist, and none share the scope of this project.
</p>
<p>
In November 2019, the family has been updated to a variable font family.
</p>

This project is led by Georg Duffner, and developed at <a href="https://github.com/georgd/EB-Garamond">github.com/georgd/EB-Garamond</a>

<p>The Eagle Lake typeface is a calligraphic lettering style based on the practical Running Book Hand. It has shorter capitals that create a visually taller x-height lending to high legibility and fluidity.</p><p>
Dynapuff’s loveable demeanor and hand-drawn charm makes it well suited for your, <i>“zomg’s”</i> and <i>“asdfajlskdfjalksdfjkj’s”</i>. 
😂😂😂😂😂 Dynapuff features OpenType code that alternates the vertical position of the letters to make those <i>“noooooooooo waaaaaaay”</i>s appear hand-drawn 
and less like a robot texting on a typewriter. 
Give it a whirl in Google’s keyboard (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin">Gboard</a>) 
where you can transform text messages into typographic stickers. 
Plain text <i>“hahas”</i> are a thing of the past after you’ve sent an <i>“lol”</i> in Dynapuff.
</p>

<p>
What Dynapuff might lack in subtlety, it makes up for it with its playful and flexible typographic energy. 
Designed by Toshi Omagari, this casual typeface is optimized for legibility in small text environments like stickers or candy packaging. 
It also manages to be large when displayed in children’s books to shop signage.

<p>The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection is an intriguing reminder of the heady days of hand lettering and calligraphy in the United States. From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.</p> <p>Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein.</p><p>DotumChe is a well-known gothic-style font that first shipped with Windows 95.

<p>I always been attracted to condensed typefaces, and one of the first I came across was Empire, designed by Morris Benton Fuller for ATF in 1937. I first spotted it in an architecture book at my college's library while doing homework.</p> <p>Dorsa is a modern interpretation of Empire with some personal details. When I start sketching I knew it would be a little less condensed than the original Empire because I wanted it to be used for use in titles, and combined with positive letter spacing it gives an elegant look to text. Although the original hasn't got a lowercase, I studied a lot of skyline typefaces and drew a fully original lowercase.</p> <p>I started with lowercase “o”, which isn't completely geometric, it is expanded to the outside, keeping the same whitespace through all weights. And this repeats all over the typeface, because the construction of all the characters was modular, based on that “o”; the “f” is designed to not meet any of the diacritics; and uppercase “A” has a traditional form, because I think this is more legible.</p><p><strong>Foundry: <a href="http://www.sorkintype.com">Sorkin Type Co</a></strong></p>

From the very first steps in the design process, Domine was designed, tested and optimized for body text on the web.
Harmless to the eyes when reading long texts, Domine is a perfect choice for newspapers or magazines websites, where text is the main focus.
It shines at px sizes 14 and 16, and can even be used as small as 11 px.
</p>
<p>
Friendly in appearance, it combines the classic elements of familiar typefaces that have been in use from more than 100 years like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarendon_(typeface)">Clarendon</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_type_family">Century</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheltenham_(typeface)">Cheltenham</a> and 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearface">Clearface</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The rounded letters (b, c, d, e, o, p, q) are a bit squarish on the inside.
This feature opens up the counters for better rendering and also make it look a bit more up-to-date than the classic typefaces previously referenced.
</li>
<li>
The serifs are a bit shorter than usual.
Another feature that improves the rendering by allowing more "air" between each letter pair.
</li>
<li>
The joins of the stems to the branches in letters like h, m, n are deep enough to prevent dark spots, also improving legibility at small sizes.
</li>
<li>
The friendly lowercase 'a', with the curve starting from the bottom of the stem, is reminiscent of Cheltenham and Clearface.
That soft curve is also echoed in the curves of the f, j, n, m and r.
</li>
<li>
The spacing is also optimized for body text on the web, clearly more open than that of typefaces made for print or for headlines.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Diplomata started several years ago when a friend in the printing industry
who had an old metal typeface wanted it to be digitalized for offset printing.
He brought everything the original type offered as a start, a set of upper
case characters, numbers, and some punctuation marks.</p>

<p>But what he brought in printed form was not enough to meet his needs, and
letterforms that did not exist had to be created. It is a fine job to
reinterpret a design, to make decisions on what already exists and also have
in mind the changes needed for the new technological context where Diplomata
will be used.</p>

<p>Its style, similar to Bodoni, has a remarkable degree of horizontal
expansion; a weight which indicates verticality; areas between serif and stem
softened by a curve connecting them, and the light in the main stroke of each
glyph is a detail that lightens up and gives prominence to Diplomata. It is a
distinct typeface, ideal for composing headlines and small prestigious pieces
of text.</p>

<p>The February 2023 update features a bigger glyphset, fractions and some minor aesthetic modifications.</p>

<p>To improve and expand the use of Diplomata, it was necessary to create
small caps and <a
href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Diplomata">a lower case</a>,
which ended up constituting this family that has two variables today.</p>

    Diphylleia is a typeface based on the motif of the song "Diphylleia grayi" by singer Jonghyun of SHINee; designed to better convey his sentimental lyrics. The typeface was inspired by the affectionate expression of the song about how the flower becomes transparent and disappearing, and puts these impressions into the brush style strokes. Diphylleia grayi is a mysterious flower that gets transparent when the water touches its petals.

Dekko’s personality is both warm and casual. 
It originated with Modular InfoTech's 4948, and was modified to feel more written and regular in appearance and weight. 
The inter-letter spacing of the design is now wider, allowing for it to be used at smaller sizes on screens. 
Dekko also comes with a complete set of Latin which matches the Devanagari in weight and and size, and originates with <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Short+Stack">Short Stack</a>.
Both the Devanagari and the Latin are based on written forms, and their stroke contrast has thick horizontals. 
The pen angles traditionally associated with Devanagari has some diagonal stress, but here the Latin script uses a vertical stress.

<b>Updated:</b> Improvements made to OpenType shaping and vertical metrics in May 2015.
</p><p>Days One is an experiment, which was established in 2008 by three people: Alexander Kalachev, Ivan Gladkikh, Alexei Maslov. Letterforms are wide, and the strokes are thick. This makes Days One good for headlines. It is similar to the more Regular weight font 'Numans' also available in Google Web Fonts.</p><p>Dawning of a New Day is based on the handwriting of a friend.  The title was chosen by my friend, but also had great meaning to me. I like to think of each new day as a chance to start fresh, free from past mistakes. It is my desire that the light, fluid motions of this script mimic that hopeful feeling.</p><p>David Libre is a Libre David Hebrew, based on David Hadash Formal, released by Monotype Corporation in 2012. David Hadash Formal is a modern digitization made from original large scale technical drawings for the typeface drawn by Ismar David.</p>

<p>Google has worked with Monotype to release the 3 book weights (Regular, Medium and Bold) under the SIL Open Font License and create a new version for use by the public.</p>

<p>This project includes working with the David Hadash sources to create a new version, that fits the requirements of Israeli instituions, since David is the official font for Israeli correspondence.</p>

<p>Some glyphs were updated, such as the Sheqel symbol. It was redesigned to be recognizable by contemporary Hebrew readers, since the original Sheqel symbol is too far from today's standard.</p>

<p>Latin characters from the Gentium typeface were derived and integrated to accommodate cases in which Latin and Hebrew characters will be used in tandem.</p>

<p>Each font includes OpenType features required for diacritic marks (nikud) and Hebrew-specific uses, including alternative Hebrew-height numerals (available as Stylistic Set 1) an alternative "Hebrew ampersand" symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 2) and an alternative Sheqel symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 3.)</p>

<p>Every effort was made to keep the original designs intact, and the type's original spacing is well preserved. However, several changes have been made to fit with David Libre's goal to be used as a free alternative to the David font commonly installed on PCs. In order to be compatible with documents previously set in the version of David bundled with Microsoft Windows, David Hadash's glyph size has been reduced by 12.5%. This was made to prevent cases in which documents previously typed in Microsoft's David to take up more pages and cause odd line breaks. Please note that this does not guarantee full compatibility with that David, only a close approximation.</p>

<p>Diacritic marks have been repositioned. Biblical cantillation marks are not supported.</p>

<p>The construction of David Libre was made by Meir Sadan, commissioned by Google for the Google Fonts project.</p>

<p>The David Libre project is led by Meir Sadan, a type designer based in Tel Aviv, Israel. To contribute, see <a href="https://github.com/meirsadan/david-libre"></a>github.com/meirsadan/david-libre</a>.</p>

<p>Cute Font is a Korean and Latin font</p><p>Cuprum was created in 2006 based on the works Miles Newlyn. Cuprum is a narrow grotesque. It is quite versatile. Mostly how it is now, I do not like myself, because as time passed and since then I have learned to make fonts much better. An interesting history of the appearance of his name: Cuprum is copper, not gold or silver. Copper is too noble, but it is much cheaper and copper is not used for medals – only pots.</p><p>Croissant is a typeface inspired by the Parisian spirit, in the people and
the landscapes there. The lowercase letters have smooth round shapes, and a
nice long out-stroke to connect nearly every glyph, reminding the reader of
elegant French handwriting. The uppercases have a classical structure and soft
terminals that embody the spirit of this multi-purpose typeface.</p>

Crimson Pro is a serif typeface family: Contemporary, clear, classic and rounded/open. Something for a college textbook, editorial websites and any reading experience with book-length texts
It contributes to the tradition of beautiful Garamond-inspired typefaces, often called “Garalde” or “Old Style,” and has 8 named weights, in Roman and Italic, and is available as a Variable Font with a Weight axis.
</p>
<p>
The first Crimson design was initiated by Sebastian Kosch in 2009, and he later completely redrew a new version called Crimson Prime.
Google commissioned Jacques Le Bailly to review both typefaces, and develop Crimson Pro as a new design that synthesises both designs into a final authoritative family, first released in January 2019.
All decisions were made to enable better readability for longer texts and the ability to make good and diverse typography.

Crete Round is a warm slab serif providing a hint of softness to texts.
It started as a tailored version of the <a href="http://www.type-together.com/Crete">original Crete fonts</a>, created specially to serve as corporate typeface for the type design competition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110826033437/http://letter2.org">Letter2</a>.
Crete Round is more independent from the original with modified terminals and serifs to create two new fonts that deliver a more contemporary and functional appearance.
The tall x-height, low contrast and sturdy slabs prove to be surprisingly efficient for web use.

Cormorant is a free display type family developed by Christian Thalmann. 
The project currently comprises a total of 45 font files spanning 9 different visual styles (Roman, Italic, Infant, Infant Italic, Garamond, Garamond Italic, Upright Cursive, Small Caps, and Unicase) and 5 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold.) Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts.

While this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for the designs. 
Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.

<p><strong>Coral Pixels</strong> is a color font inspired by subpixel rendering techniques. It elevates the retro pixel font style commonly seen in games and digital art by infusing it with color, creating a more vibrant and dynamic digital aesthetic. Beyond being merely a font, it offers a new dimension for visual expression.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Subpixel Rendering Expression:</strong> By applying display technology to font design, Coral Pixels creates a depth and dimensionality not typically found in traditional fonts. This innovative approach could inspire new ideas for retro game pixel art.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Rich Color Expression:</strong> The font's glyphs, when viewed from a distance, appear as blurred black text. However, upon closer inspection, they reveal a random arrangement of colorful dots, offering a unique and visually engaging experience.</li>

    <li><strong>Transparency Implementation:</strong> Coral Pixels incorporates transparency into its color elements to minimize the occurrence of unsightly fringes. While this design choice enhances the font's appearance, it can result in a loss of color vibrancy when used against dark backgrounds. As a temporary workaround, we recommend using color inversion or other adjustments within your application.</li>
</ul>

It was created by two designers with very different ideas, who took advantage of their divergent criteria to draw glyphs that made the Upright and Italic styles converge without mixing them.</p> <p>In this way, it was possible to converge the inclination of an Upright Sans Serif with a Sans Serif Italic.  Looking at the font in detail, the bottom halves of the glyphs have Transitive serifs while the upper halves conserve the Sans Serif terminals.  Other specific details can be seen in the a, g, and e glyphs, which have an Italic structure, not an Upright one.  In addition, the glyph for the letter r has a relatively closed instroke.</p> <p>The references used to develop this font were Bree from TypeTogether, Parisine de Porchez Typofonderie, and, undeniably, Ludovico Degli Arrighi's manuscript about the structure the "humanistic cursive" that is Convergence.</p> <p>Designed by <a href="https://plus.google.com/112934564034615336086/posts">Nicolas Silva</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/zar_nicolas20">@zar_nicolas20</a>) and <a href="https://plus.google.com/104510930456899325757/posts">John Vargas</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/vargas74">@vargas74</a>)</p><p><strong>Foundry: <a href="http://www.sorkintype.com">Sorkin Type Co</a></strong></p>

The family consists of three “voices”. The default style is a grotesque with straight stems. As the flair axis grows the straight grotesque terminals develop a swelling and become almost glyphic serifs and the joints become more idiosyncratic. The volume axis transforms the glyphic serifs to wedge-like ones.
</p>

<p>Each voice of Commissioner comes in a range of styles from Thin to Black including italics. The diverse proportions of lowercase and capitals add warmth and appeal to texts across sizes, while the different voices can express a variation in the typographic texture that ranges from delicate in text sizes to exuberant in larger sizes.

    Castoro Titling is an all-caps font in which the uppercase of the Castoro text typeface has been ‘re-hung’ on the proportions of Roman inscriptional letters. These lighter, elegant forms are ideal for larger sizes. The font covers the same set of extended diacritics for European orthographies and for transliteration of Indian languages.
</p>

<p>
    Castoro Titling was designed by John Hudson.
</p>

<p>
    Castoro began as a synthesis of aspects of assorted Dutch types from the 16–18th Centuries and was initially made for the Indic fonts that Tiro produced for Harvard University Press. The version released as Castoro retains the extensive diacritic set for transliteration of South Asian languages and additional characters for an increased number of European languages.
</p>

<p>
    Castoro is named for the North American beaver, Castor canadensis. Robust serif text types with extensive language and typographic layout support are sometimes referred to as &apos;workhorse&apos; types. Castoro may be thought of as a busy beaver.
</p>

<p>
    The roman was designed by John Hudson, and the italic with his Tiro colleague Paul Hanslow, assisted by Kaja Słojewska.

<p>Capriola is a sans-serif typeface whose unique style draws upon forms seen in handwriting and italic types. Skeletons of the most characteristic glyphs are inspired by quick handwriting and based on a single hand movement (G,a,g,k,e). Capriola ambitiously seeks to push the boundaries of originality in the genre without losing legibility.</p>

<p>The unusual glyphs are quite noticeable in large sizes which allows for distinctive headlines. However in small sizes these gestures become less noticeable making it possible to set longer texts. The name "Capriola" means somersault in English. Such glyphs as "a", "e" or "G" are the real acrobats and the "g" makes a double salto! Capriola was spaced for web. Capriola's originality combined with utility makes it ideal for a wide range of uses.</p>

</p><p>Cantora ('Singer' in Spanish) is a friendly semi formal, semi condensed,
semi sans serif. It has reminiscences of hand lettering, mixing straight and

<p>The Cantarell typeface family was designed during Dave Crossland's study of MA Typeface Design in 2009 in the Department of Typography at the University of Reading (UK).</p> 

<p>The typeface is designed as a contemporary Humanist sans serif, and was developed for on-screen reading; in particular, reading web pages on an HTC Dream mobile phone.</p>  

<p>This family was developed using only open-source softwares, mainly FontForge. Typeface designs are tools too, and therefore these font files are licensed in a way that respects your freedom — you are invited to extend them to meet your needs, such as to add the glyphs missing from your own writing systems, under the terms of the Open Font License.</p>

<p> In October 2022 some metadata were fixed such as license clification, style name and style linking. Users may notice that the style "Oblique" has changed to "Italic".</p>

</p><p>Cal Sans is a geometric sans-serif typeface designed for display, particularly large point sizes. It was created by Mark Davis for Cal.com by Peer Richelsen and Bailey Pumfleet, with interface design by Ciarán Hanrahan, and is open source. The design aims for a serious and geometric aesthetic, ensuring circular shapes throughout the “cal.com” lettering.</p>

<p>To contribute, see <a href="https://github.com/calcom/font">github.com/calcom/font</a>.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Cal Sans is a geometric sans-serif tuned for display, that is, large point sizes. It is an Open Source typeface to adorn the headlines and interfaces of <a href="https://cal.com">Cal.com</a>, a company founded by <a href="https://x.com/peer_rich">Peer Richelsen</a> and <a href="https://x.com/BaileyPumfleet">Bailey Pumfleet</a> and interface design by <a href="https://x.com/CiaranHan">Ciarán Hanrahan</a>.</p>

<p>The basis of Cal Sans is my initial answer to what my Futura would be. It fit well with Peer’s brief, for something serious and and geometric so that the letters of “cal.com” would have circular shapes throughout. It was decided early on that it be open source for all!</p>

<img src="image1.jpg">

<hr>
<h3>Design Philosophy and Unique Characteristics</h3>

<p>As this design was created for display, and is currently a single static font, an unusual approach is taken for its texture and default typography. Letters are intentionally spaced to be extremely close for tight headlines “out of the box.” For smaller subheadings, positive letter spacing must be applied. There are currently no other Open Source geometric sanserifs geared as intentionally for “tight but not touching” typesetting—as it is more labor intensive to produce with accurate texture. But for typesetters, if they would letterspace another design as tight as Cal Sans, the results would not be as consistent.</p>

<img src="image2.gif">

<p>So, for end users, more flexibility is available when the tightest typesetting extreme edge case is gracefully addressed. One may create looser typesetting as needed.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Features</h3>

<p>While the default design is fairly ahistorical, there are historical design options. Using Stylistic Set 01 (ss01), Futura-specific alternates can be deployed. Including diacritic variants, there are 48 alternates for this set.</p>

<img src="image3.jpg">

<p>I give credit to <a href="https://x.com/rsms">Rasmus Andersson</a> implementing in his design <a href = "https://github.com/rsms/inter">Inter</a> Character Variants to offer more control in website typography. Cal Sans also employs this feature. There are six Character Variants in Cal Sans, for Cc (cv01), j (cv02), t (cv03), u (cv04), 0 (cv05), and 1 (cv06).</p>

<p>In celebration of Futura’s geometrically extreme ligatures, Cal Sans has an experimental approach to ligatures, Stylistic Set 02 (ss02) is identical to ss01, but also combines eligible letters as historical Futura ligatures. This is included as a stylistic set and not as discretionary ligatures because default characters really do not match these historical ligatures. (But they were included anyway!)</p>

<img src="image4.jpg">

<p>Probably the most novel OpenType feature of Cal Sans is its third Stylistic Set (ss03). The best way to exhibit the need of ss03 is to see how “tight but not touching” affects spacing with consecutive diagonals. Some designers would never want their letters to overlap or touch in a headline, or very large title.</p>

<img src="image5.gif">

<p>Diagonals’ corners are kerned from eachother, and some might say this causes more problems than the “stock” kerning solves. Such letter combinations aren’t…incredibly common. But they are not rare, nor is spacing letters in a way that is sometimes consistent a goal of mine. But, I see merits in both paths. So, ss03 overrides diagonal-to-diagonal kerning pairs with new ones that let diagonal corners “crash.”</p>

<p>I don’t know of any other typefaces that has many kerning options, hopefully this feature is of use! Thanks to Tal Leming’s OpenType Cook Book for technical details.</p>

<p>Cagliostro was inspired by the early 20th Century lettering work of Ozwald Bruce Cooper. Care was taken to preserve the original hand-lettered feel of his work while updating the style for modern use.

	In the crowded urban environment, space for signage is always at a premium.
	From crummy liquor stores to majestic theaters, sometimes signs have nowhere to
	go but up.
</p>
<p>
	Bungee is a font that celebrates urban signs that stack the Latin alphabet, one
	letter on top of the other, in order to make dramatic use of limited space.
	Following their lead, Bungee typesets horizontally <em>and</em> vertically, so
	it is always ready to take your text in a new direction.
</p>
<p>
	Bungee’s letterforms were designed to reinforce a sense of verticality. Round
	characters like <strong>O</strong> and diagonal characters like
	<strong>A</strong> are straight-sided, and letters like <strong>L</strong> and
	<strong>I</strong> gain serifs in order to create vertical words with
	well-defined left and right edges.

<h4>Bungee’s color fonts</h4>
<p>
	Bungee was an early
	<a href="https://www.economist.com/babbage/2013/08/22/over-the-rainbow"
		>experimental color font</a>, and has been updated as color font technology
		has developed over the past	decade. Both Bungee Tint (flat colors) and
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee+Spice">Bungee Spice</a>
	(gradients) contain multiple color palettes, so it is possible to create
	chromatic effects even in the most basic typesetting environments. Hopefully
	these fonts will help designers and developers explore the possibilities of
	what color fonts have to offer.

<h4>Bungee’s color fonts</h4>
<p>
	Bungee was an early
	<a href="https://www.economist.com/babbage/2013/08/22/over-the-rainbow"
		>experimental color font</a>, and has been updated as color font technology
		has developed over the past	decade. Both Bungee Tint (flat colors) and
	<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee+Spice">Bungee Spice</a>
	(gradients) contain multiple color palettes, so it is possible to create
	chromatic effects even in the most basic typesetting environments. Hopefully
	these fonts will help designers and developers explore the possibilities of
	what color fonts have to offer.

 Buenard is a high-quality serif typeface for art books.
 It is based on the Transitional Roman classical structure, with less contrasted strokes and heavier serifs.
</p>
<p>
 It has its own contemporary style, combining elegance, consistency and legibility for all text sizes, making it an excellent choice when selecting a serif font.
</p>
<p>
 Buenard was initially designed for an Argentinian art publisher and progressed as a final project in the Postgraduate Career in Typography at the University of Buenos Aires.

<p>Against the typographical grey, Buda is a black and white typeface. The letters are shared by two contrasting weights, which clash and balance each other out. This typeface is inspired by Budapest, a paradoxal town, beautiful and ugly, fragile and exuberant. Like this town, the typeface Buda is an assemblage of heterogeneous elements which form a harmony.</p><p>Bubbler One is an original font with thin strokes that are particularly
straight. It is a legible typeface in small sizes. You can use Bubbler One for
any kind of text, formal or informal, big or small; I hope you find it
useful!</p>

    Brygada 1918 is a revival project created for the celebration of the 100 years of independance of the Republic of Poland in 2018, with the support of the "Independent" program and the President of the Republic of Poland. The typeface is based on the catalogue
    entry of the National Type Foundry from 1954, and a set of matrices found at the Book Arts Museum by Janusz Tryzno in 2016.

Briem Hand is elegant while also being quite accessible and very legible. It is direct and sincere without being excessively sentimental. It provides a range of weights, and comes with and without guides and joins. Briem Hand is an extended version of Gunnlaugur's 'Briem Script' which was designed in 1992. The Briem Hand is a modern adaptation of sixteenth-century chancery cursive.
</p>

<p>Briem Hand includes Latin Vietnamese, all Western, Central, and South-Eastern European languages, Sami, South American and nearly all African language support, as well as several OpenType features (old-style and tabular figures, superscript and subscript numerals, fractions, stylistic alternates).</p>

<p>Bricolage Grotesque is a collage of lots of different things: historical sources, technical decisions and personal feelings. It started as a fork of <a href="https://studiotriple.fr/travaux/typefaces/mayenne">Mayenne Sans</a>, an open-source single weight font designed by Jérémy Landes (Studio Triple). It evolved by reinforcing cues from French sources and British sources: the compressed weights lean more towards the anxious and wonky tones of Grotesque Nº9 and the regular weights have a bit more of Antique Olive's relaxed and confident attitude. The smaller optical sizes become more neutral and reflective of contemporary sans serifs, notably through the use of exaggerated ink traps.</p>

<p>By blending iconic British and French designs with modern trends and tools, it aims to traverse a complex typographical and emotional landscape. At the same time, it’s so steeped in historical sources and references that it’s hard to call it anything but a re-interpretation of the same ideas but for a different purpose: trying to express visually what it feels like to move countries and rebuild, what it feels like to have a hybrid identity where you cannot be what you were and yet you can never truly be anybody else.</p>

    What considerations should be taken into account when approaching typography in the context of simultaneous learning of reading and writing? Borel is a French cursive primer — developed with primary school teachers and speech therapists — which aims aims to harmonise cursive strokes and common typographic structure. This typeface, named in tribute to Suzanne Borel-Maisonny (a pioneer in speech therapy), boasts a sturdy design featuring low contrast and a generous x-height. The letters are intentionally open and clearly differentiated while adhering to the conventions of handwriting in French schools. 
</p>
<p>
    Due to the specifity of this project, the font only supports a limited set of glyphs allowing to write in French, English, Spanish, Catalan, German, Portuguese, Turkish and Vietnamese. Please submit language requests with images in the issue tracker of the reposotory linked below.

<p>Boogaloo was started in 2010 as a complement to the Salsa typeface, while thinking about type used in Latin American music genres and the culture's own identity. The structure of Boogaloo is that of classic American lettering, found so often in old LP albums cover art from the 1960s, when Latin music became very popular and preceding the birth of the musical phenomenon of Salsa. Functionally this typeface can be used to display texts that wish to remind readers of the 1960s, Latin music. There is movement, coolness and happiness across all its forms.</p><p>
It's casual and contemporary. BonheurRoyale has the look of a calligraphic hand with a slightly brush feel. The contrast of this and thin strokes gives this clean style a legible quality.

<p>Bonbon is a fancy handwriting font for cheerful and bright headlines. The letterforms are artistic and naive as if they are written in a teenage girl's diary. It is drawn with a fine marker by author Ksenia Erulevich. Curves are carefully adjusted so that the font will also work well in print - making it a good choice for appetizing product design, greeting cards, or titling in children's books. Extra ornamental characters are included.</p><p>Bona Nova is a digitisation of Bona, a cursive typeface designed in 1971 by Andrzej Heidrich — the creator of Polish banknotes. Besides giving it a digital form, this project was the opportunity to expand the character set, design the small caps, alternates and opentype functions for the typeface. Two new versions has been created together with the original author; a Regular and a Bold, to give the family a form of a classical triad.</p>

Blinker is a low contrast sans serif typeface with a <em>squircle</em> as its basic shape, think squarish curves, or Eurostyle’s flamboyant cousin. It’s best used for medium to large text, rather than a long copy. To do its claim justice Blinker also comes with a headline weight with an extra large x-height, tight spacing, and glyphs drawn more narrowly. Blink!

    <em>Blaka</em> is an experimental typeface, enriching the gothic feeling of Black Letters by enhancing the
    geometric features to create midgrounds with the Kufic style for the Arabic letterforms.
</p>
<p>
    The aesthetical matching process between the two scripts relies on the features of being hand-drawn with a reed
    pen. While Latin letterforms maintain sharp edges, Arabic relies on sharp edges and thick strokes to create overlaps
    to replace a usual baseline in most letterforms, giving the Arabic letterforms contemporary features.
</p>
<p>
    The font family comes in two styles, Blaka and Blaka Hollow, featuring an outlined version of the font. Blaka also
    comes in two variants, the usual monochrome variants as well as an Ink variant <em>Blaka Ink</em>. The Ink variant
    are color fonts where the colors are defined by the font itself. Support for color fonts is currently limited to few
    applications like Google Chrome (version 98 or later).

 People read and interact with text on screens more and more each day.
 What happens on screen ends up being more important than what comes out of the printer.
 With the accelerating popularity of electronic books, type designers are working hard to seek out the ideal designs for reading on screen.
</p>
<p>
 Motivated by her love for the pixel, Sol Matas designed Bitter.
 A "contemporary" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on any computer or device.
 The robust design started from the austerity of the pixel grid, based on rational rather than emotional principles.
 It combines the large x-heights and legibility of the humanistic tradition with subtle characteristics in the characters that inject a certain rhythm to flowing texts.
</p>
<p>
 Bitter has little variation in stroke weight and the Regular style is thicker than a usual ‘Regular’ style for print design.
 This generates an intense color in paragraphs, accentuated by the serifs that are as thick as strokes with square terminals.
</p>
<p>
 Each glyph is carefully designed with an excellent curve quality added to the first stage of the design, that was entirely made in a pixel grid.
 The typeface is balanced and manually spaced to use very few kerning pairs.

<p>Bitcount is perfect for creating layered typographic effects using different colors and font styles. A slight shift in position creates shadows, highlights, and 3D effects. If you want to reproduce a certain combination on your own site, download Bitcount, copy the HTML/CSS, and integrate the code into your site. Or just keep playing!</p>

<p>To contribute, please see <a href="https://github.com/petrvanblokland/TYPETR-Bitcount">github.com/petrvanblokland/TYPETR-Bitcount</a>.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image0.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<h3>Bitcount</h3> 
    
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>Bitcount is a family of styles, where the core shape of letters has been reduced to the minimal number of pixels possible. We need at least 5 vertical pixels of x-height to draw “a” and “e”. Adding the minimum of 1 pixel as ascender and 1 pixel as descender, the minimum grid is 5 pixels wide and 7 pixel high. Here the <em>Bitcount Single Regular</em> is shown.</p>

<img src="image1.png">

<p>The large number of styles in the Bitcount family come from the virtually infinite amount of variations that are possible, even with this small amount of 35+ pixels. The styles vary in articulation of accent shapes, one or two pixel stems, roman or slanted, normal or condensed. And all of this with a range of pixels shapes, such as large/small circles and large/small squares. Here showing respectively <em>Bitcount Single Regular Circle, Bitcount Double Regular Circle and Bitcount Single Regular Square.</em></p>

<img src="image2.png">

<p>In order to find the best selection of styles for a specific task, this “manual” is available, illustrated with a large number of examples.</p>

<p>And even Python/DrawBot programs are available for users who want to dive into it to that level of detail. E.g. to create similar animations to the ones shown in this manual.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>There are many ways to use Bitcount. To name a few from practice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As decorative type design, e.g. by combining a number of layers, each with their own pixel shape, color and transparency.</li>
  <li>Layers can be used to simulate 3-D effects – suggesting shadow and globes with highlights – by not centering them on purpose.</li>
  <li>As type design for usage in hardware devices (such as running LED-displays) where there is very limited space, or if there is a fixed grid.</li>
  <li>As display type in very small sizes in very low resolution or as hard-core bitmap fonts, e.g. to build into low-resolution devices, such as displays and printers.</li>
  <li>As template for physical type, e.g. with LEGO bricks, flower-pots or lights behind a grid of windows in a building.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Decorative designs</h5>

<p>Since most of the Bitcount letters within the same variant (Grid, Mono, or Prop) have identical spacing, they can be used in overlapping layers to create colorful decorative type.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Multiple layers of Bitcount generate an infinite amount of pixels shape combinations.</p>

<p>The animated examples give fast overview of possible combination, in plain or transparent colors.</p>

<img src="image4.png">

<p>For a whole letter this would look like this:</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image5.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Here is an overview of 3 random layers. Each of these combinations can be used as pixel shape for any layer combination of Bitcount letters.</p>

<img src="image6.png">

<h4>Running LED-displays</h4>

<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Grid Double</em> with fixed height in 7 pixel grid display and fixed monospaced width of 6 pixels. Note the use of <em>Bitcount Grid Double Italic</em> to simulate the slanted delay of electronics in physical LED-displays with running text.</p>

<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Prop Single</em> with height of 10 pixels, with extended ascenders and descenders (by OpenType Features) and proportional spacing. Also here, <em>Bitcount Prop Single Italic</em> is used to slant the running text.</p>

<h4>Low resolution screens</h4>

<p>Weight variations can be made by altering the pixel size (or intensity), instead of adding more pixels. Although the 2-pixel contrast stem of the Double variant in this example could be interpreted as bold, it is compensated by using very small or light pixels.</p>

<img src="image9.png">

<h3>Overview of typographic values</h3>

<h4>Spacing</h4>

<p>There are three spacing variants in the Bitcount family: Grid, Mono and Prop. The variants Grid and Mono are “monospaced”, all letters have the same width of 6 pixels. Since letters as “l” and “i” normally need less spacing, the fixed width is bridged by adding serifs where necessary, although the basics of Bitcount is sans-serif. In the Prop variant all letters have their own widths, dependent on the space they need, but all widths are rounded to whole pixels distances.</p>

<img src="image12.png">

<h4>Tracking</h4>

<p>The internal measures of the font is defined in a way that it is easy to measure. Each pixel has a distance of 100 units of the total 1000 units of the Em-square. This means that the width of a pixel (and thus of the spacing) is 1/10 of the font size. This way tracking can be calculated. For each extra pixel to the spacing of letters, Adobe InDesign needs a tracking of 10.</p>

<img src="image13.png">

<h4>Kerning</h4>

<p>Since the Grid and Mono are monospaced variants, by definition they cannot have any kerning. All letters in all combinations have a width of 6 pixels. That is different in the Prop variant. Letter combinations have their own kerning value, to optimize their spacing. In the design of Bitcount Prop all capital-capital combination have two pixels spacing, where capital-lowercase have a spacing of one pixel. This difference is solved by kerning.</p>

<img src="image14.png">

<p>As with spacing and tracking, all kerning is rounded to whole pixels. In traditional typographic spacing this may not always be exactly right, in the matrix-grid of Bitcount, the designed spacing is the “best possible”, given the limitations of the grid.</p>

<h4>Ascenders and descenders</h4>

<h5><em>Grid</em></h5>

<p>All letters in the Grid variant have a total height of not more than 7 pixels, one pixels for ascenders and one pixel for descenders. As it is impossible to express articulation in the shape of accents, they are all reduced to one or two pixels. The size of accented capitals it reduced to 5 pixels to accommodate the accent on top. This makes the capital shape identical to the small-caps. Here showing the accent letters “AÁÃaáã” using Grid and Mono on their grids of respectively 7 pixels and 10 pixel high.</p>

<img src="image15.png">

<h5><em>Mono and Prop</em></h5>

<p>In the Bitcount Mono and Prop variants capital, ascenders and descender heights can be extended using one or all of the stylistic OpenType Features Extended capital, Extended ascender and Extended descender.</p>

<img src="image16.png">

<p>Extending the capitals is made as a separate OT-feature, so the user can choose to make the capitals the same size as the ascenders (7 pixels), or use the set that is one pixels smaller (6 pixels).</p>

<img src="image17.png">

<h4>x-height and cap-height</h4>

<p>The standard x-height for all Bitcount variants is 5 pixels.</p>

<img src="image18.png">

<p>The smallest proportions can be found in the Grid variant. Lowercase letters are mostly made with a grid of 5 x 5 pixels. In the standard grid of 5 x 7, that leaves room for one pixel ascender and one pixel descender.</p>

<h4>Contrast and weight</h4>

<p>Due to the nature of pixel letter in such low resolution, there is almost no freedom to express contrast in letterforms. The difference between thick and thin areas comes from the distance between close horizontal adjacent pixels (darker) and the larger distance between diagonal pixels (lighter). Often this happens in places where the contrast should be the other way around.</p>
  
<p>Within the limitations of what is possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Single and Double</em> variants</li>
  <li>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</li>
  <li>Size and shape of pixels</li>
</ul>

<h5>Single and Double variants.</h5>

<p>Bitcount provides two ways of controlling the contrast. The variants Single and Double respectively have letters with one and two pixel stems. Although this difference can be interpreted and used as “Roman” and “Bold”, it is not necessarily the only usage. The Double (with more expression of the tick-thin relation on the right spot).</p>

<img src="image19.png">

<h4>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</h4>

<p>In Single variant there is an OT-Feature available to add a pixel where contrast is needed, especially in the diagonal connections. Of course this feature only works if there enough space, such as “O” and “C”.</p>

<img src="image20.png">

<p>In the Double variants is the feature selected by default. There the OT-Feature No contrast pixel is necessary to turn the contrast pixel off.</p>

<img src="image21.png">

<p>In the OT Feature Condensed selection, the extra contrast pixel is not available, due to the restriction of space.</p>

<h4>Size and shape of pixels</h4>

<p>The base package of Bitcount includes four sizes/weight for each unique pixel shape. There are five sizes of Circles (Light, Book, Regular, Medium and Bold) and there are five corresponding sizes of Square and Plus pixels. The Regular weight is by definition the size of pixels that exactly fit the grid of 100 units. Future releases of Bitcount packages will include more weights and shapes.</p>

<img src="image22.png">

<p>Due to the difference area coverage of Circles and Squares, their visual weight is not equal. This can also be used by the designer as an expression for typographic weight difference.</p>

<img src="image23.png">

<p>Within the range of similar pixels shapes the weights are relative. For the sake of consistency, the weight name refers to the size of the pixel, not the optical weight. This is best visible in the pixels where the inside is open. Here is an example of the Line Circle pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image24.png">

<p>And here is an example of the Line Square pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image25.png">

<p>Completing the types of pixels shapes in the basic package of Bitcount, this is the weight range of the Plus shape.</p>

<img src="image26.png">

<p>The line width and the size of all Plus pixels is adjusted to the size of the Line pixels. This gives the option to “cut” a cross from the other pixels, such as Line Circle and Square in multiple layers. Visualized in this animation of layers:</p>

<h4>Width</h4>

<p>The Single variants implement an OT-Feature Condensed that does display much of the glyph set as condensed. For the monospaced Grid and Mono variants this means that one pixel is added to the right side of each letter, to keep the same monospaced width of 6 pixels. But the optically wider spacing is not a problem, especially when used is small sizes.</p>

<img src="image27.png">

<p>For the Prop variant it means that the condensed letters are spaced one pixel more narrow than the monospaced.</p>

<img src="image28.png">

<h4>Italic</h4>

<p>In Bitcount a separation is made between the italic (slanted) angle of the stems (defined by the selection of the font style), and the italic shapes of letters (by selecting the OpenType Feature). This means that all 4 combination are available to the user.</p>

<img src="image29.png">

<p>An alternative “g” is available as OT-Feature, but due to the complexity of the shape at low resolution, it is not made default for upright-roman (as it could have been in a regular type design).</p>

<img src="image30.png">

<p>The Circle pixel shapes are not altered when slanted. But the Square pixels (and others with straight sides) are using slanted versions of the pixel shape to make the stems appear to be slanted.</p>

<img src="image31.png">

<h3>Glyph set</h3>

<h4>Small-caps</h4>

<p>Both OT-Feature Lowercase to small-caps and Captial to small-caps are implemented for all Bitcount variants.</p>

<p>Conversion with Lowercase to small-caps looks like this for the Mono Single variant:</p>

<img src="image32.png">

<p>And like this for the Prop Single variant:</p>

<img src="image33.png">

<p>Conversion with OT-Feature Capital to small-caps looks like this:</p>

<img src="image34.png">

<h5>Figures in Single</h5>

<p>Bitcount implements seven sets of figures for the Single variant and five sets for the Double variant. In the example image they are showing in order of:</p>

<p>Mono Single figures on fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image35.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Condensed).</p>

<img src="image36.png">

<p>Mono Single figures width extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image37.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Extended capitals and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image38.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase figures).</p>

<img src="image39.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase figures and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image40.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image41.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase to small-caps and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image42.png">

<p>Prop Single with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width. The use of fractions is limited in this low resolution of 2x4 pixels (where the only possible design option for the zero is two horizontal lines), but for completeness it is good to have the full characters set available in fonts like this. Also the readability of fractional figures is very much dependent on the context, the shape and size of the pixels. It is up to the designer to decide if usage is appropriate in a given situation.</p>

<img src="image43.png">

<p>Both Prop Single and Prop Double include the OT-feature tnum (table numbers), which will force the figures (and some related characters like valuta, period, and comma) to a fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image44.png">

<h4>Figures in Double</h4>

<p>As the Double does not have a Condensed OT-feature, there is only four sets of figures.</p>

<p>Mono Double figures on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image45.png">

<p>Mono Double figures width extended height on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image46.png">

<p>Mono Double small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image47.png">

<p>Prop Double with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width.</p>

<img src="image48.png">

<p>In all variant styles there are alternate slashed zeros available as OT-Feature zero.</p>

<img src="image49.png">

<h4>Matrix</h4>

<p>In case the full set of pixels is need (e.g. as a background layer with LED’s that are on/off), there are several matrices available when the OT feature Ligature is turned on. The availability of the matrix depends on the variant. In the illustration respectively are shown /matrix57, /matrix58, /matrix68, /matrix610. Also the TYPETR logo is available /typetr.</p>

<img src="image50.png">

<h3>OpenType Features</h3>

<p>Not all OpenType Features are available in every Bitcount variant. See the Reference for more details, specific per style.</p>

<h3>The Making of Bitcount</h3>

<p>The Bitcount project started in the late 70’s as an experiment to find the minimum amount of pixels necessary to define a full set of ASCII characters. Mainstream as that may seem today, it wasn’t at that time.</p>

<img src="image51.png">

<p>In the seventies, digital typefaces for printing were hidden deep inside commercial typesetting machines (starting as scanned photo negatives, not even as digital outline information). Or they were stored as bitmap in terminal screens. Resolution and speed were costly resources, so the bitmap was hardcoded into the screen electronics, often just for one size.</p>

<p>It was the general convention at that time, that for Latin, at least 9 pixels where necessary to make a clear distinction between ascenders (7), capitals (6), lowercase (5), and descenders (2). Furthermore, all letters
needed to be monospaced, because there was no way pixels could be stored as in modern graphic screens. The shapes were generated by hardware during the sweep of scan-lines of the television screen. Proportional spacing would have added a lot more costly hardware.</p>

<p>The design of these pixel grids was exclusively the domain of engineering: Take a matrix and add pixels until it can be recognized as an “n”. The problem with this approach is that “contrast” seems like luxury, not worth considering (if such a thing was considered at all). The stems of such an “n” have a width of one pixel, vertical and horizontal equally spaced. But simple mathematics shows that if the horizontal distance between pixels is 1, the diagonal distance between points is 1.41, showing as a lighter area in the letter. The problem is in the resulting contrast in the diagonals.</p>

<img src="image52.png">

<p>This is not a problem where bows run in to stems, but on the top-right of the “n” it is a problem, because that is traditionally the darkest part of the letter shape. The contrast makes the difference between “n” and “h” 3 pixels, instead of the traditional one pixel. This compensates for the relative small ascender length of only one pixel.</p>

<img src="image53.png">

<p>Early sketches of the 5 x 7 pixel grid show that even in a small design space of 35 pixels, the number of different options is enormous. Note the various alternatives for the “m”, to make it fit in the impossible width of 5 pixels. It is common understanding in design, that what first seems to be an extreme reduction of design options, in reality still needs a design process to find the best choice. Or to create alternative solutions that work just as well or better.</p>
<p>Bitcount is perfect for creating layered typographic effects using different colors and font styles. A slight shift in position creates shadows, highlights, and 3D effects. If you want to reproduce a certain combination on your own site, download Bitcount, copy the HTML/CSS, and integrate the code into your site. Or just keep playing!</p>

<h3>Bitcount</h3> 
    
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>Bitcount is a family of styles, where the core shape of letters has been reduced to the minimal number of pixels possible. We need at least 5 vertical pixels of x-height to draw “a” and “e”. Adding the minimum of 1 pixel as ascender and 1 pixel as descender, the minimum grid is 5 pixels wide and 7 pixel high. Here the <em>Bitcount Single Regular</em> is shown.</p>

<img src="image1.png">

<p>The large number of styles in the Bitcount family come from the virtually infinite amount of variations that are possible, even with this small amount of 35+ pixels. The styles vary in articulation of accent shapes, one or two pixel stems, roman or slanted, normal or condensed. And all of this with a range of pixels shapes, such as large/small circles and large/small squares. Here showing respectively <em>Bitcount Single Regular Circle, Bitcount Double Regular Circle and Bitcount Single Regular Square.</em></p>

<img src="image2.png">

<p>In order to find the best selection of styles for a specific task, this “manual” is available, illustrated with a large number of examples.</p>

<p>And even Python/DrawBot programs are available for users who want to dive into it to that level of detail. E.g. to create similar animations to the ones shown in this manual.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>There are many ways to use Bitcount. To name a few from practice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As decorative type design, e.g. by combining a number of layers, each with their own pixel shape, color and transparency.</li>
  <li>Layers can be used to simulate 3-D effects – suggesting shadow and globes with highlights – by not centering them on purpose.</li>
  <li>As type design for usage in hardware devices (such as running LED-displays) where there is very limited space, or if there is a fixed grid.</li>
  <li>As display type in very small sizes in very low resolution or as hard-core bitmap fonts, e.g. to build into low-resolution devices, such as displays and printers.</li>
  <li>As template for physical type, e.g. with LEGO bricks, flower-pots or lights behind a grid of windows in a building.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Decorative designs</h5>

<p>Since most of the Bitcount letters within the same variant (Grid, Mono, or Prop) have identical spacing, they can be used in overlapping layers to create colorful decorative type.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Multiple layers of Bitcount generate an infinite amount of pixels shape combinations.</p>

<p>The animated examples give fast overview of possible combination, in plain or transparent colors.</p>

<img src="image4.png">

<p>For a whole letter this would look like this:</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image5.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Here is an overview of 3 random layers. Each of these combinations can be used as pixel shape for any layer combination of Bitcount letters.</p>

<img src="image6.png">

<h4>Running LED-displays</h4>

<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Grid Double</em> with fixed height in 7 pixel grid display and fixed monospaced width of 6 pixels. Note the use of <em>Bitcount Grid Double Italic</em> to simulate the slanted delay of electronics in physical LED-displays with running text.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image7.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Prop Single</em> with height of 10 pixels, with extended ascenders and descenders (by OpenType Features) and proportional spacing. Also here, <em>Bitcount Prop Single Italic</em> is used to slant the running text.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image8.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<h4>Low resolution screens</h4>

<p>Weight variations can be made by altering the pixel size (or intensity), instead of adding more pixels. Although the 2-pixel contrast stem of the Double variant in this example could be interpreted as bold, it is compensated by using very small or light pixels.</p>

<img src="image9.png">

<h3>Overview of typographic values</h3>

<h4>Spacing</h4>

<p>There are three spacing variants in the Bitcount family: Grid, Mono and Prop. The variants Grid and Mono are “monospaced”, all letters have the same width of 6 pixels. Since letters as “l” and “i” normally need less spacing, the fixed width is bridged by adding serifs where necessary, although the basics of Bitcount is sans-serif. In the Prop variant all letters have their own widths, dependent on the space they need, but all widths are rounded to whole pixels distances.</p>

<img src="image12.png">

<h4>Tracking</h4>

<p>The internal measures of the font is defined in a way that it is easy to measure. Each pixel has a distance of 100 units of the total 1000 units of the Em-square. This means that the width of a pixel (and thus of the spacing) is 1/10 of the font size. This way tracking can be calculated. For each extra pixel to the spacing of letters, Adobe InDesign needs a tracking of 10.</p>

<img src="image13.png">

<h4>Kerning</h4>

<p>Since the Grid and Mono are monospaced variants, by definition they cannot have any kerning. All letters in all combinations have a width of 6 pixels. That is different in the Prop variant. Letter combinations have their own kerning value, to optimize their spacing. In the design of Bitcount Prop all capital-capital combination have two pixels spacing, where capital-lowercase have a spacing of one pixel. This difference is solved by kerning.</p>

<img src="image14.png">

<p>As with spacing and tracking, all kerning is rounded to whole pixels. In traditional typographic spacing this may not always be exactly right, in the matrix-grid of Bitcount, the designed spacing is the “best possible”, given the limitations of the grid.</p>

<h4>Ascenders and descenders</h4>

<h5><em>Grid</em></h5>

<p>All letters in the Grid variant have a total height of not more than 7 pixels, one pixels for ascenders and one pixel for descenders. As it is impossible to express articulation in the shape of accents, they are all reduced to one or two pixels. The size of accented capitals it reduced to 5 pixels to accommodate the accent on top. This makes the capital shape identical to the small-caps. Here showing the accent letters “AÁÃaáã” using Grid and Mono on their grids of respectively 7 pixels and 10 pixel high.</p>

<img src="image15.png">

<h5><em>Mono and Prop</em></h5>

<p>In the Bitcount Mono and Prop variants capital, ascenders and descender heights can be extended using one or all of the stylistic OpenType Features Extended capital, Extended ascender and Extended descender.</p>

<img src="image16.png">

<p>Extending the capitals is made as a separate OT-feature, so the user can choose to make the capitals the same size as the ascenders (7 pixels), or use the set that is one pixels smaller (6 pixels).</p>

<img src="image17.png">

<h4>x-height and cap-height</h4>

<p>The standard x-height for all Bitcount variants is 5 pixels.</p>

<img src="image18.png">

<p>The smallest proportions can be found in the Grid variant. Lowercase letters are mostly made with a grid of 5 x 5 pixels. In the standard grid of 5 x 7, that leaves room for one pixel ascender and one pixel descender.</p>

<h4>Contrast and weight</h4>

<p>Due to the nature of pixel letter in such low resolution, there is almost no freedom to express contrast in letterforms. The difference between thick and thin areas comes from the distance between close horizontal adjacent pixels (darker) and the larger distance between diagonal pixels (lighter). Often this happens in places where the contrast should be the other way around.</p>
  
<p>Within the limitations of what is possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Single and Double</em> variants</li>
  <li>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</li>
  <li>Size and shape of pixels</li>
</ul>

<h5>Single and Double variants.</h5>

<p>Bitcount provides two ways of controlling the contrast. The variants Single and Double respectively have letters with one and two pixel stems. Although this difference can be interpreted and used as “Roman” and “Bold”, it is not necessarily the only usage. The Double (with more expression of the tick-thin relation on the right spot).</p>

<img src="image19.png">

<h4>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</h4>

<p>In Single variant there is an OT-Feature available to add a pixel where contrast is needed, especially in the diagonal connections. Of course this feature only works if there enough space, such as “O” and “C”.</p>

<img src="image20.png">

<p>In the Double variants is the feature selected by default. There the OT-Feature No contrast pixel is necessary to turn the contrast pixel off.</p>

<img src="image21.png">

<p>In the OT Feature Condensed selection, the extra contrast pixel is not available, due to the restriction of space.</p>

<h4>Size and shape of pixels</h4>

<p>The base package of Bitcount includes four sizes/weight for each unique pixel shape. There are five sizes of Circles (Light, Book, Regular, Medium and Bold) and there are five corresponding sizes of Square and Plus pixels. The Regular weight is by definition the size of pixels that exactly fit the grid of 100 units. Future releases of Bitcount packages will include more weights and shapes.</p>

<img src="image22.png">

<p>Due to the difference area coverage of Circles and Squares, their visual weight is not equal. This can also be used by the designer as an expression for typographic weight difference.</p>

<img src="image23.png">

<p>Within the range of similar pixels shapes the weights are relative. For the sake of consistency, the weight name refers to the size of the pixel, not the optical weight. This is best visible in the pixels where the inside is open. Here is an example of the Line Circle pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image24.png">

<p>And here is an example of the Line Square pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image25.png">

<p>Completing the types of pixels shapes in the basic package of Bitcount, this is the weight range of the Plus shape.</p>

<img src="image26.png">

<p>The line width and the size of all Plus pixels is adjusted to the size of the Line pixels. This gives the option to “cut” a cross from the other pixels, such as Line Circle and Square in multiple layers. Visualized in this animation of layers:</p>

<h4>Width</h4>

<p>The Single variants implement an OT-Feature Condensed that does display much of the glyph set as condensed. For the monospaced Grid and Mono variants this means that one pixel is added to the right side of each letter, to keep the same monospaced width of 6 pixels. But the optically wider spacing is not a problem, especially when used is small sizes.</p>

<img src="image27.png">

<p>For the Prop variant it means that the condensed letters are spaced one pixel more narrow than the monospaced.</p>

<img src="image28.png">

<h4>Italic</h4>

<p>In Bitcount a separation is made between the italic (slanted) angle of the stems (defined by the selection of the font style), and the italic shapes of letters (by selecting the OpenType Feature). This means that all 4 combination are available to the user.</p>

<img src="image29.png">

<p>An alternative “g” is available as OT-Feature, but due to the complexity of the shape at low resolution, it is not made default for upright-roman (as it could have been in a regular type design).</p>

<img src="image30.png">

<p>The Circle pixel shapes are not altered when slanted. But the Square pixels (and others with straight sides) are using slanted versions of the pixel shape to make the stems appear to be slanted.</p>

<img src="image31.png">

<h3>Glyph set</h3>

<h4>Small-caps</h4>

<p>Both OT-Feature Lowercase to small-caps and Captial to small-caps are implemented for all Bitcount variants.</p>

<p>Conversion with Lowercase to small-caps looks like this for the Mono Single variant:</p>

<img src="image32.png">

<p>And like this for the Prop Single variant:</p>

<img src="image33.png">

<p>Conversion with OT-Feature Capital to small-caps looks like this:</p>

<img src="image34.png">

<h5>Figures in Single</h5>

<p>Bitcount implements seven sets of figures for the Single variant and five sets for the Double variant. In the example image they are showing in order of:</p>

<p>Mono Single figures on fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image35.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Condensed).</p>

<img src="image36.png">

<p>Mono Single figures width extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image37.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Extended capitals and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image38.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase figures).</p>

<img src="image39.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase figures and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image40.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image41.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase to small-caps and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image42.png">

<p>Prop Single with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width. The use of fractions is limited in this low resolution of 2x4 pixels (where the only possible design option for the zero is two horizontal lines), but for completeness it is good to have the full characters set available in fonts like this. Also the readability of fractional figures is very much dependent on the context, the shape and size of the pixels. It is up to the designer to decide if usage is appropriate in a given situation.</p>

<img src="image43.png">

<p>Both Prop Single and Prop Double include the OT-feature tnum (table numbers), which will force the figures (and some related characters like valuta, period, and comma) to a fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image44.png">

<h4>Figures in Double</h4>

<p>As the Double does not have a Condensed OT-feature, there is only four sets of figures.</p>

<p>Mono Double figures on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image45.png">

<p>Mono Double figures width extended height on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image46.png">

<p>Mono Double small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image47.png">

<p>Prop Double with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width.</p>

<img src="image48.png">

<p>In all variant styles there are alternate slashed zeros available as OT-Feature zero.</p>

<img src="image49.png">

<h4>Matrix</h4>

<p>In case the full set of pixels is need (e.g. as a background layer with LED’s that are on/off), there are several matrices available when the OT feature Ligature is turned on. The availability of the matrix depends on the variant. In the illustration respectively are shown /matrix57, /matrix58, /matrix68, /matrix610. Also the TYPETR logo is available /typetr.</p>

<img src="image50.png">

<h3>OpenType Features</h3>

<p>Not all OpenType Features are available in every Bitcount variant. See the Reference for more details, specific per style.</p>

<h3>The Making of Bitcount</h3>

<p>The Bitcount project started in the late 70’s as an experiment to find the minimum amount of pixels necessary to define a full set of ASCII characters. Mainstream as that may seem today, it wasn’t at that time.</p>

<img src="image51.png">

<p>In the seventies, digital typefaces for printing were hidden deep inside commercial typesetting machines (starting as scanned photo negatives, not even as digital outline information). Or they were stored as bitmap in terminal screens. Resolution and speed were costly resources, so the bitmap was hardcoded into the screen electronics, often just for one size.</p>

<p>It was the general convention at that time, that for Latin, at least 9 pixels where necessary to make a clear distinction between ascenders (7), capitals (6), lowercase (5), and descenders (2). Furthermore, all letters
needed to be monospaced, because there was no way pixels could be stored as in modern graphic screens. The shapes were generated by hardware during the sweep of scan-lines of the television screen. Proportional spacing would have added a lot more costly hardware.</p>

<p>The design of these pixel grids was exclusively the domain of engineering: Take a matrix and add pixels until it can be recognized as an “n”. The problem with this approach is that “contrast” seems like luxury, not worth considering (if such a thing was considered at all). The stems of such an “n” have a width of one pixel, vertical and horizontal equally spaced. But simple mathematics shows that if the horizontal distance between pixels is 1, the diagonal distance between points is 1.41, showing as a lighter area in the letter. The problem is in the resulting contrast in the diagonals.</p>

<img src="image52.png">

<p>This is not a problem where bows run in to stems, but on the top-right of the “n” it is a problem, because that is traditionally the darkest part of the letter shape. The contrast makes the difference between “n” and “h” 3 pixels, instead of the traditional one pixel. This compensates for the relative small ascender length of only one pixel.</p>

<img src="image53.png">

<p>Early sketches of the 5 x 7 pixel grid show that even in a small design space of 35 pixels, the number of different options is enormous. Note the various alternatives for the “m”, to make it fit in the impossible width of 5 pixels. It is common understanding in design, that what first seems to be an extreme reduction of design options, in reality still needs a design process to find the best choice. Or to create alternative solutions that work just as well or better.</p>
<p>Bitcount is perfect for creating layered typographic effects using different colors and font styles. A slight shift in position creates shadows, highlights, and 3D effects. If you want to reproduce a certain combination on your own site, download Bitcount, copy the HTML/CSS, and integrate the code into your site. Or just keep playing!</p>

<h3>Bitcount</h3> 
    
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>Bitcount is a family of styles, where the core shape of letters has been reduced to the minimal number of pixels possible. We need at least 5 vertical pixels of x-height to draw “a” and “e”. Adding the minimum of 1 pixel as ascender and 1 pixel as descender, the minimum grid is 5 pixels wide and 7 pixel high. Here the <em>Bitcount Single Regular</em> is shown.</p>

<img src="image1.png">

<p>The large number of styles in the Bitcount family come from the virtually infinite amount of variations that are possible, even with this small amount of 35+ pixels. The styles vary in articulation of accent shapes, one or two pixel stems, roman or slanted, normal or condensed. And all of this with a range of pixels shapes, such as large/small circles and large/small squares. Here showing respectively <em>Bitcount Single Regular Circle, Bitcount Double Regular Circle and Bitcount Single Regular Square.</em></p>

<img src="image2.png">

<p>In order to find the best selection of styles for a specific task, this “manual” is available, illustrated with a large number of examples.</p>

<p>And even Python/DrawBot programs are available for users who want to dive into it to that level of detail. E.g. to create similar animations to the ones shown in this manual.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>There are many ways to use Bitcount. To name a few from practice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As decorative type design, e.g. by combining a number of layers, each with their own pixel shape, color and transparency.</li>
  <li>Layers can be used to simulate 3-D effects – suggesting shadow and globes with highlights – by not centering them on purpose.</li>
  <li>As type design for usage in hardware devices (such as running LED-displays) where there is very limited space, or if there is a fixed grid.</li>
  <li>As display type in very small sizes in very low resolution or as hard-core bitmap fonts, e.g. to build into low-resolution devices, such as displays and printers.</li>
  <li>As template for physical type, e.g. with LEGO bricks, flower-pots or lights behind a grid of windows in a building.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Decorative designs</h5>

<p>Since most of the Bitcount letters within the same variant (Grid, Mono, or Prop) have identical spacing, they can be used in overlapping layers to create colorful decorative type.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Multiple layers of Bitcount generate an infinite amount of pixels shape combinations.</p>

<p>The animated examples give fast overview of possible combination, in plain or transparent colors.</p>

<img src="image4.png">

<p>For a whole letter this would look like this:</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image5.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Here is an overview of 3 random layers. Each of these combinations can be used as pixel shape for any layer combination of Bitcount letters.</p>

<img src="image6.png">

<h4>Running LED-displays</h4>

<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Grid Double</em> with fixed height in 7 pixel grid display and fixed monospaced width of 6 pixels. Note the use of <em>Bitcount Grid Double Italic</em> to simulate the slanted delay of electronics in physical LED-displays with running text.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image7.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Prop Single</em> with height of 10 pixels, with extended ascenders and descenders (by OpenType Features) and proportional spacing. Also here, <em>Bitcount Prop Single Italic</em> is used to slant the running text.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image8.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<h4>Low resolution screens</h4>

<p>Weight variations can be made by altering the pixel size (or intensity), instead of adding more pixels. Although the 2-pixel contrast stem of the Double variant in this example could be interpreted as bold, it is compensated by using very small or light pixels.</p>

<img src="image9.png">

<h3>Overview of typographic values</h3>

<h4>Spacing</h4>

<p>There are three spacing variants in the Bitcount family: Grid, Mono and Prop. The variants Grid and Mono are “monospaced”, all letters have the same width of 6 pixels. Since letters as “l” and “i” normally need less spacing, the fixed width is bridged by adding serifs where necessary, although the basics of Bitcount is sans-serif. In the Prop variant all letters have their own widths, dependent on the space they need, but all widths are rounded to whole pixels distances.</p>

<img src="image12.png">

<h4>Tracking</h4>

<p>The internal measures of the font is defined in a way that it is easy to measure. Each pixel has a distance of 100 units of the total 1000 units of the Em-square. This means that the width of a pixel (and thus of the spacing) is 1/10 of the font size. This way tracking can be calculated. For each extra pixel to the spacing of letters, Adobe InDesign needs a tracking of 10.</p>

<img src="image13.png">

<h4>Kerning</h4>

<p>Since the Grid and Mono are monospaced variants, by definition they cannot have any kerning. All letters in all combinations have a width of 6 pixels. That is different in the Prop variant. Letter combinations have their own kerning value, to optimize their spacing. In the design of Bitcount Prop all capital-capital combination have two pixels spacing, where capital-lowercase have a spacing of one pixel. This difference is solved by kerning.</p>

<img src="image14.png">

<p>As with spacing and tracking, all kerning is rounded to whole pixels. In traditional typographic spacing this may not always be exactly right, in the matrix-grid of Bitcount, the designed spacing is the “best possible”, given the limitations of the grid.</p>

<h4>Ascenders and descenders</h4>

<h5><em>Grid</em></h5>

<p>All letters in the Grid variant have a total height of not more than 7 pixels, one pixels for ascenders and one pixel for descenders. As it is impossible to express articulation in the shape of accents, they are all reduced to one or two pixels. The size of accented capitals it reduced to 5 pixels to accommodate the accent on top. This makes the capital shape identical to the small-caps. Here showing the accent letters “AÁÃaáã” using Grid and Mono on their grids of respectively 7 pixels and 10 pixel high.</p>

<img src="image15.png">

<h5><em>Mono and Prop</em></h5>

<p>In the Bitcount Mono and Prop variants capital, ascenders and descender heights can be extended using one or all of the stylistic OpenType Features Extended capital, Extended ascender and Extended descender.</p>

<img src="image16.png">

<p>Extending the capitals is made as a separate OT-feature, so the user can choose to make the capitals the same size as the ascenders (7 pixels), or use the set that is one pixels smaller (6 pixels).</p>

<img src="image17.png">

<h4>x-height and cap-height</h4>

<p>The standard x-height for all Bitcount variants is 5 pixels.</p>

<img src="image18.png">

<p>The smallest proportions can be found in the Grid variant. Lowercase letters are mostly made with a grid of 5 x 5 pixels. In the standard grid of 5 x 7, that leaves room for one pixel ascender and one pixel descender.</p>

<h4>Contrast and weight</h4>

<p>Due to the nature of pixel letter in such low resolution, there is almost no freedom to express contrast in letterforms. The difference between thick and thin areas comes from the distance between close horizontal adjacent pixels (darker) and the larger distance between diagonal pixels (lighter). Often this happens in places where the contrast should be the other way around.</p>
  
<p>Within the limitations of what is possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Single and Double</em> variants</li>
  <li>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</li>
  <li>Size and shape of pixels</li>
</ul>

<h5>Single and Double variants.</h5>

<p>Bitcount provides two ways of controlling the contrast. The variants Single and Double respectively have letters with one and two pixel stems. Although this difference can be interpreted and used as “Roman” and “Bold”, it is not necessarily the only usage. The Double (with more expression of the tick-thin relation on the right spot).</p>

<img src="image19.png">

<h4>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</h4>

<p>In Single variant there is an OT-Feature available to add a pixel where contrast is needed, especially in the diagonal connections. Of course this feature only works if there enough space, such as “O” and “C”.</p>

<img src="image20.png">

<p>In the Double variants is the feature selected by default. There the OT-Feature No contrast pixel is necessary to turn the contrast pixel off.</p>

<img src="image21.png">

<p>In the OT Feature Condensed selection, the extra contrast pixel is not available, due to the restriction of space.</p>

<h4>Size and shape of pixels</h4>

<p>The base package of Bitcount includes four sizes/weight for each unique pixel shape. There are five sizes of Circles (Light, Book, Regular, Medium and Bold) and there are five corresponding sizes of Square and Plus pixels. The Regular weight is by definition the size of pixels that exactly fit the grid of 100 units. Future releases of Bitcount packages will include more weights and shapes.</p>

<img src="image22.png">

<p>Due to the difference area coverage of Circles and Squares, their visual weight is not equal. This can also be used by the designer as an expression for typographic weight difference.</p>

<img src="image23.png">

<p>Within the range of similar pixels shapes the weights are relative. For the sake of consistency, the weight name refers to the size of the pixel, not the optical weight. This is best visible in the pixels where the inside is open. Here is an example of the Line Circle pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image24.png">

<p>And here is an example of the Line Square pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image25.png">

<p>Completing the types of pixels shapes in the basic package of Bitcount, this is the weight range of the Plus shape.</p>

<img src="image26.png">

<p>The line width and the size of all Plus pixels is adjusted to the size of the Line pixels. This gives the option to “cut” a cross from the other pixels, such as Line Circle and Square in multiple layers. Visualized in this animation of layers:</p>

<h4>Width</h4>

<p>The Single variants implement an OT-Feature Condensed that does display much of the glyph set as condensed. For the monospaced Grid and Mono variants this means that one pixel is added to the right side of each letter, to keep the same monospaced width of 6 pixels. But the optically wider spacing is not a problem, especially when used is small sizes.</p>

<img src="image27.png">

<p>For the Prop variant it means that the condensed letters are spaced one pixel more narrow than the monospaced.</p>

<img src="image28.png">

<h4>Italic</h4>

<p>In Bitcount a separation is made between the italic (slanted) angle of the stems (defined by the selection of the font style), and the italic shapes of letters (by selecting the OpenType Feature). This means that all 4 combination are available to the user.</p>

<img src="image29.png">

<p>An alternative “g” is available as OT-Feature, but due to the complexity of the shape at low resolution, it is not made default for upright-roman (as it could have been in a regular type design).</p>

<img src="image30.png">

<p>The Circle pixel shapes are not altered when slanted. But the Square pixels (and others with straight sides) are using slanted versions of the pixel shape to make the stems appear to be slanted.</p>

<img src="image31.png">

<h3>Glyph set</h3>

<h4>Small-caps</h4>

<p>Both OT-Feature Lowercase to small-caps and Captial to small-caps are implemented for all Bitcount variants.</p>

<p>Conversion with Lowercase to small-caps looks like this for the Mono Single variant:</p>

<img src="image32.png">

<p>And like this for the Prop Single variant:</p>

<img src="image33.png">

<p>Conversion with OT-Feature Capital to small-caps looks like this:</p>

<img src="image34.png">

<h5>Figures in Single</h5>

<p>Bitcount implements seven sets of figures for the Single variant and five sets for the Double variant. In the example image they are showing in order of:</p>

<p>Mono Single figures on fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image35.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Condensed).</p>

<img src="image36.png">

<p>Mono Single figures width extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image37.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Extended capitals and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image38.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase figures).</p>

<img src="image39.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase figures and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image40.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image41.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase to small-caps and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image42.png">

<p>Prop Single with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width. The use of fractions is limited in this low resolution of 2x4 pixels (where the only possible design option for the zero is two horizontal lines), but for completeness it is good to have the full characters set available in fonts like this. Also the readability of fractional figures is very much dependent on the context, the shape and size of the pixels. It is up to the designer to decide if usage is appropriate in a given situation.</p>

<img src="image43.png">

<p>Both Prop Single and Prop Double include the OT-feature tnum (table numbers), which will force the figures (and some related characters like valuta, period, and comma) to a fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image44.png">

<h4>Figures in Double</h4>

<p>As the Double does not have a Condensed OT-feature, there is only four sets of figures.</p>

<p>Mono Double figures on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image45.png">

<p>Mono Double figures width extended height on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image46.png">

<p>Mono Double small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image47.png">

<p>Prop Double with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width.</p>

<img src="image48.png">

<p>In all variant styles there are alternate slashed zeros available as OT-Feature zero.</p>

<img src="image49.png">

<h4>Matrix</h4>

<p>In case the full set of pixels is need (e.g. as a background layer with LED’s that are on/off), there are several matrices available when the OT feature Ligature is turned on. The availability of the matrix depends on the variant. In the illustration respectively are shown /matrix57, /matrix58, /matrix68, /matrix610. Also the TYPETR logo is available /typetr.</p>

<h3>OpenType Features</h3>

<p>Not all OpenType Features are available in every Bitcount variant. See the Reference for more details, specific per style.</p>

<h3>The Making of Bitcount</h3>

<p>The Bitcount project started in the late 70’s as an experiment to find the minimum amount of pixels necessary to define a full set of ASCII characters. Mainstream as that may seem today, it wasn’t at that time.</p>

<h3>Bitcount</h3> 
    
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>Bitcount is a family of styles, where the core shape of letters has been reduced to the minimal number of pixels possible. We need at least 5 vertical pixels of x-height to draw “a” and “e”. Adding the minimum of 1 pixel as ascender and 1 pixel as descender, the minimum grid is 5 pixels wide and 7 pixel high. Here the <em>Bitcount Single Regular</em> is shown.</p>

<img src="image1.png">

<p>The large number of styles in the Bitcount family come from the virtually infinite amount of variations that are possible, even with this small amount of 35+ pixels. The styles vary in articulation of accent shapes, one or two pixel stems, roman or slanted, normal or condensed. And all of this with a range of pixels shapes, such as large/small circles and large/small squares. Here showing respectively <em>Bitcount Single Regular Circle, Bitcount Double Regular Circle and Bitcount Single Regular Square.</em></p>

<img src="image2.png">

<p>In order to find the best selection of styles for a specific task, this “manual” is available, illustrated with a large number of examples.</p>

<p>And even Python/DrawBot programs are available for users who want to dive into it to that level of detail. E.g. to create similar animations to the ones shown in this manual.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>There are many ways to use Bitcount. To name a few from practice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As decorative type design, e.g. by combining a number of layers, each with their own pixel shape, color and transparency.</li>
  <li>Layers can be used to simulate 3-D effects – suggesting shadow and globes with highlights – by not centering them on purpose.</li>
  <li>As type design for usage in hardware devices (such as running LED-displays) where there is very limited space, or if there is a fixed grid.</li>
  <li>As display type in very small sizes in very low resolution or as hard-core bitmap fonts, e.g. to build into low-resolution devices, such as displays and printers.</li>
  <li>As template for physical type, e.g. with LEGO bricks, flower-pots or lights behind a grid of windows in a building.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Decorative designs</h5>

<p>Since most of the Bitcount letters within the same variant (Grid, Mono, or Prop) have identical spacing, they can be used in overlapping layers to create colorful decorative type.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Multiple layers of Bitcount generate an infinite amount of pixels shape combinations.</p>

<p>The animated examples give fast overview of possible combination, in plain or transparent colors.</p>

<img src="image4.png">

<p>For a whole letter this would look like this:</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image5.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Here is an overview of 3 random layers. Each of these combinations can be used as pixel shape for any layer combination of Bitcount letters.</p>

<img src="image6.png">

<h4>Running LED-displays</h4>

<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Grid Double</em> with fixed height in 7 pixel grid display and fixed monospaced width of 6 pixels. Note the use of <em>Bitcount Grid Double Italic</em> to simulate the slanted delay of electronics in physical LED-displays with running text.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image7.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Prop Single</em> with height of 10 pixels, with extended ascenders and descenders (by OpenType Features) and proportional spacing. Also here, <em>Bitcount Prop Single Italic</em> is used to slant the running text.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image8.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<h4>Low resolution screens</h4>

<p>Weight variations can be made by altering the pixel size (or intensity), instead of adding more pixels. Although the 2-pixel contrast stem of the Double variant in this example could be interpreted as bold, it is compensated by using very small or light pixels.</p>

<img src="image9.png">

<h3>Overview of typographic values</h3>

<h4>Spacing</h4>

<p>There are three spacing variants in the Bitcount family: Grid, Mono and Prop. The variants Grid and Mono are “monospaced”, all letters have the same width of 6 pixels. Since letters as “l” and “i” normally need less spacing, the fixed width is bridged by adding serifs where necessary, although the basics of Bitcount is sans-serif. In the Prop variant all letters have their own widths, dependent on the space they need, but all widths are rounded to whole pixels distances.</p>

<img src="image12.png">

<h4>Tracking</h4>

<p>The internal measures of the font is defined in a way that it is easy to measure. Each pixel has a distance of 100 units of the total 1000 units of the Em-square. This means that the width of a pixel (and thus of the spacing) is 1/10 of the font size. This way tracking can be calculated. For each extra pixel to the spacing of letters, Adobe InDesign needs a tracking of 10.</p>

<img src="image13.png">

<h4>Kerning</h4>

<p>Since the Grid and Mono are monospaced variants, by definition they cannot have any kerning. All letters in all combinations have a width of 6 pixels. That is different in the Prop variant. Letter combinations have their own kerning value, to optimize their spacing. In the design of Bitcount Prop all capital-capital combination have two pixels spacing, where capital-lowercase have a spacing of one pixel. This difference is solved by kerning.</p>

<img src="image14.png">

<p>As with spacing and tracking, all kerning is rounded to whole pixels. In traditional typographic spacing this may not always be exactly right, in the matrix-grid of Bitcount, the designed spacing is the “best possible”, given the limitations of the grid.</p>

<h4>Ascenders and descenders</h4>

<h5><em>Grid</em></h5>

<p>All letters in the Grid variant have a total height of not more than 7 pixels, one pixels for ascenders and one pixel for descenders. As it is impossible to express articulation in the shape of accents, they are all reduced to one or two pixels. The size of accented capitals it reduced to 5 pixels to accommodate the accent on top. This makes the capital shape identical to the small-caps. Here showing the accent letters “AÁÃaáã” using Grid and Mono on their grids of respectively 7 pixels and 10 pixel high.</p>

<img src="image15.png">

<h5><em>Mono and Prop</em></h5>

<p>In the Bitcount Mono and Prop variants capital, ascenders and descender heights can be extended using one or all of the stylistic OpenType Features Extended capital, Extended ascender and Extended descender.</p>

<img src="image16.png">

<p>Extending the capitals is made as a separate OT-feature, so the user can choose to make the capitals the same size as the ascenders (7 pixels), or use the set that is one pixels smaller (6 pixels).</p>

<img src="image17.png">

<h4>x-height and cap-height</h4>

<p>The standard x-height for all Bitcount variants is 5 pixels.</p>

<img src="image18.png">

<p>The smallest proportions can be found in the Grid variant. Lowercase letters are mostly made with a grid of 5 x 5 pixels. In the standard grid of 5 x 7, that leaves room for one pixel ascender and one pixel descender.</p>

<h4>Contrast and weight</h4>

<p>Due to the nature of pixel letter in such low resolution, there is almost no freedom to express contrast in letterforms. The difference between thick and thin areas comes from the distance between close horizontal adjacent pixels (darker) and the larger distance between diagonal pixels (lighter). Often this happens in places where the contrast should be the other way around.</p>
  
<p>Within the limitations of what is possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Single and Double</em> variants</li>
  <li>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</li>
  <li>Size and shape of pixels</li>
</ul>

<h5>Single and Double variants.</h5>

<p>Bitcount provides two ways of controlling the contrast. The variants Single and Double respectively have letters with one and two pixel stems. Although this difference can be interpreted and used as “Roman” and “Bold”, it is not necessarily the only usage. The Double (with more expression of the tick-thin relation on the right spot).</p>

<img src="image19.png">

<h4>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</h4>

<p>In Single variant there is an OT-Feature available to add a pixel where contrast is needed, especially in the diagonal connections. Of course this feature only works if there enough space, such as “O” and “C”.</p>

<img src="image20.png">

<p>In the Double variants is the feature selected by default. There the OT-Feature No contrast pixel is necessary to turn the contrast pixel off.</p>

<img src="image21.png">

<p>In the OT Feature Condensed selection, the extra contrast pixel is not available, due to the restriction of space.</p>

<h4>Size and shape of pixels</h4>

<p>The base package of Bitcount includes four sizes/weight for each unique pixel shape. There are five sizes of Circles (Light, Book, Regular, Medium and Bold) and there are five corresponding sizes of Square and Plus pixels. The Regular weight is by definition the size of pixels that exactly fit the grid of 100 units. Future releases of Bitcount packages will include more weights and shapes.</p>

<img src="image22.png">

<p>Due to the difference area coverage of Circles and Squares, their visual weight is not equal. This can also be used by the designer as an expression for typographic weight difference.</p>

<img src="image23.png">

<p>Within the range of similar pixels shapes the weights are relative. For the sake of consistency, the weight name refers to the size of the pixel, not the optical weight. This is best visible in the pixels where the inside is open. Here is an example of the Line Circle pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image24.png">

<p>And here is an example of the Line Square pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image25.png">

<p>Completing the types of pixels shapes in the basic package of Bitcount, this is the weight range of the Plus shape.</p>

<img src="image26.png">

<p>The line width and the size of all Plus pixels is adjusted to the size of the Line pixels. This gives the option to “cut” a cross from the other pixels, such as Line Circle and Square in multiple layers. Visualized in this animation of layers:</p>

<h4>Width</h4>

<p>The Single variants implement an OT-Feature Condensed that does display much of the glyph set as condensed. For the monospaced Grid and Mono variants this means that one pixel is added to the right side of each letter, to keep the same monospaced width of 6 pixels. But the optically wider spacing is not a problem, especially when used is small sizes.</p>

<img src="image27.png">

<p>For the Prop variant it means that the condensed letters are spaced one pixel more narrow than the monospaced.</p>

<img src="image28.png">

<h4>Italic</h4>

<p>In Bitcount a separation is made between the italic (slanted) angle of the stems (defined by the selection of the font style), and the italic shapes of letters (by selecting the OpenType Feature). This means that all 4 combination are available to the user.</p>

<img src="image29.png">

<p>An alternative “g” is available as OT-Feature, but due to the complexity of the shape at low resolution, it is not made default for upright-roman (as it could have been in a regular type design).</p>

<img src="image30.png">

<p>The Circle pixel shapes are not altered when slanted. But the Square pixels (and others with straight sides) are using slanted versions of the pixel shape to make the stems appear to be slanted.</p>

<img src="image31.png">

<h3>Glyph set</h3>

<h4>Small-caps</h4>

<p>Both OT-Feature Lowercase to small-caps and Captial to small-caps are implemented for all Bitcount variants.</p>

<p>Conversion with Lowercase to small-caps looks like this for the Mono Single variant:</p>

<img src="image32.png">

<p>And like this for the Prop Single variant:</p>

<img src="image33.png">

<p>Conversion with OT-Feature Capital to small-caps looks like this:</p>

<img src="image34.png">

<h5>Figures in Single</h5>

<p>Bitcount implements seven sets of figures for the Single variant and five sets for the Double variant. In the example image they are showing in order of:</p>

<p>Mono Single figures on fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image35.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Condensed).</p>

<img src="image36.png">

<p>Mono Single figures width extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image37.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Extended capitals and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image38.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase figures).</p>

<img src="image39.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase figures and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image40.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image41.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase to small-caps and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image42.png">

<p>Prop Single with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width. The use of fractions is limited in this low resolution of 2x4 pixels (where the only possible design option for the zero is two horizontal lines), but for completeness it is good to have the full characters set available in fonts like this. Also the readability of fractional figures is very much dependent on the context, the shape and size of the pixels. It is up to the designer to decide if usage is appropriate in a given situation.</p>

<img src="image43.png">

<p>Both Prop Single and Prop Double include the OT-feature tnum (table numbers), which will force the figures (and some related characters like valuta, period, and comma) to a fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image44.png">

<h4>Figures in Double</h4>

<p>As the Double does not have a Condensed OT-feature, there is only four sets of figures.</p>

<p>Mono Double figures on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image45.png">

<p>Mono Double figures width extended height on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image46.png">

<p>Mono Double small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image47.png">

<p>Prop Double with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width.</p>

<img src="image48.png">

<p>In all variant styles there are alternate slashed zeros available as OT-Feature zero.</p>

<img src="image49.png">

<h4>Matrix</h4>

<p>In case the full set of pixels is need (e.g. as a background layer with LED’s that are on/off), there are several matrices available when the OT feature Ligature is turned on. The availability of the matrix depends on the variant. In the illustration respectively are shown /matrix57, /matrix58, /matrix68, /matrix610. Also the TYPETR logo is available /typetr.</p>

<img src="image50.png">

<h3>OpenType Features</h3>

<p>Not all OpenType Features are available in every Bitcount variant. See the Reference for more details, specific per style.</p>

<h3>The Making of Bitcount</h3>

<p>The Bitcount project started in the late 70’s as an experiment to find the minimum amount of pixels necessary to define a full set of ASCII characters. Mainstream as that may seem today, it wasn’t at that time.</p>

<img src="image51.png">

<p>In the seventies, digital typefaces for printing were hidden deep inside commercial typesetting machines (starting as scanned photo negatives, not even as digital outline information). Or they were stored as bitmap in terminal screens. Resolution and speed were costly resources, so the bitmap was hardcoded into the screen electronics, often just for one size.</p>

<p>It was the general convention at that time, that for Latin, at least 9 pixels where necessary to make a clear distinction between ascenders (7), capitals (6), lowercase (5), and descenders (2). Furthermore, all letters
needed to be monospaced, because there was no way pixels could be stored as in modern graphic screens. The shapes were generated by hardware during the sweep of scan-lines of the television screen. Proportional spacing would have added a lot more costly hardware.</p>

<p>The design of these pixel grids was exclusively the domain of engineering: Take a matrix and add pixels until it can be recognized as an “n”. The problem with this approach is that “contrast” seems like luxury, not worth considering (if such a thing was considered at all). The stems of such an “n” have a width of one pixel, vertical and horizontal equally spaced. But simple mathematics shows that if the horizontal distance between pixels is 1, the diagonal distance between points is 1.41, showing as a lighter area in the letter. The problem is in the resulting contrast in the diagonals.</p>

<img src="image52.png">

<p>This is not a problem where bows run in to stems, but on the top-right of the “n” it is a problem, because that is traditionally the darkest part of the letter shape. The contrast makes the difference between “n” and “h” 3 pixels, instead of the traditional one pixel. This compensates for the relative small ascender length of only one pixel.</p>

<img src="image53.png">

<p>Early sketches of the 5 x 7 pixel grid show that even in a small design space of 35 pixels, the number of different options is enormous. Note the various alternatives for the “m”, to make it fit in the impossible width of 5 pixels. It is common understanding in design, that what first seems to be an extreme reduction of design options, in reality still needs a design process to find the best choice. Or to create alternative solutions that work just as well or better.</p>
<p>Bitcount is perfect for creating layered typographic effects using different colors and font styles. A slight shift in position creates shadows, highlights, and 3D effects. If you want to reproduce a certain combination on your own site, download Bitcount, copy the HTML/CSS, and integrate the code into your site. Or just keep playing!</p>

<h3>Bitcount</h3> 
    
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>Bitcount is a family of styles, where the core shape of letters has been reduced to the minimal number of pixels possible. We need at least 5 vertical pixels of x-height to draw “a” and “e”. Adding the minimum of 1 pixel as ascender and 1 pixel as descender, the minimum grid is 5 pixels wide and 7 pixel high. Here the <em>Bitcount Single Regular</em> is shown.</p>

<img src="image1.png">

<p>The large number of styles in the Bitcount family come from the virtually infinite amount of variations that are possible, even with this small amount of 35+ pixels. The styles vary in articulation of accent shapes, one or two pixel stems, roman or slanted, normal or condensed. And all of this with a range of pixels shapes, such as large/small circles and large/small squares. Here showing respectively <em>Bitcount Single Regular Circle, Bitcount Double Regular Circle and Bitcount Single Regular Square.</em></p>

<img src="image2.png">

<p>In order to find the best selection of styles for a specific task, this “manual” is available, illustrated with a large number of examples.</p>

<p>And even Python/DrawBot programs are available for users who want to dive into it to that level of detail. E.g. to create similar animations to the ones shown in this manual.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>There are many ways to use Bitcount. To name a few from practice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As decorative type design, e.g. by combining a number of layers, each with their own pixel shape, color and transparency.</li>
  <li>Layers can be used to simulate 3-D effects – suggesting shadow and globes with highlights – by not centering them on purpose.</li>
  <li>As type design for usage in hardware devices (such as running LED-displays) where there is very limited space, or if there is a fixed grid.</li>
  <li>As display type in very small sizes in very low resolution or as hard-core bitmap fonts, e.g. to build into low-resolution devices, such as displays and printers.</li>
  <li>As template for physical type, e.g. with LEGO bricks, flower-pots or lights behind a grid of windows in a building.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Decorative designs</h5>

<p>Since most of the Bitcount letters within the same variant (Grid, Mono, or Prop) have identical spacing, they can be used in overlapping layers to create colorful decorative type.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Multiple layers of Bitcount generate an infinite amount of pixels shape combinations.</p>

<p>The animated examples give fast overview of possible combination, in plain or transparent colors.</p>

<img src="image4.png">

<p>For a whole letter this would look like this:</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image5.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Here is an overview of 3 random layers. Each of these combinations can be used as pixel shape for any layer combination of Bitcount letters.</p>

<img src="image6.png">

<h4>Running LED-displays</h4>

<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Grid Double</em> with fixed height in 7 pixel grid display and fixed monospaced width of 6 pixels. Note the use of <em>Bitcount Grid Double Italic</em> to simulate the slanted delay of electronics in physical LED-displays with running text.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image7.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Prop Single</em> with height of 10 pixels, with extended ascenders and descenders (by OpenType Features) and proportional spacing. Also here, <em>Bitcount Prop Single Italic</em> is used to slant the running text.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image8.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<h4>Low resolution screens</h4>

<p>Weight variations can be made by altering the pixel size (or intensity), instead of adding more pixels. Although the 2-pixel contrast stem of the Double variant in this example could be interpreted as bold, it is compensated by using very small or light pixels.</p>

<img src="image9.png">

<h3>Overview of typographic values</h3>

<h4>Spacing</h4>

<p>There are three spacing variants in the Bitcount family: Grid, Mono and Prop. The variants Grid and Mono are “monospaced”, all letters have the same width of 6 pixels. Since letters as “l” and “i” normally need less spacing, the fixed width is bridged by adding serifs where necessary, although the basics of Bitcount is sans-serif. In the Prop variant all letters have their own widths, dependent on the space they need, but all widths are rounded to whole pixels distances.</p>

<img src="image12.png">

<h4>Tracking</h4>

<p>The internal measures of the font is defined in a way that it is easy to measure. Each pixel has a distance of 100 units of the total 1000 units of the Em-square. This means that the width of a pixel (and thus of the spacing) is 1/10 of the font size. This way tracking can be calculated. For each extra pixel to the spacing of letters, Adobe InDesign needs a tracking of 10.</p>

<img src="image13.png">

<h4>Kerning</h4>

<p>Since the Grid and Mono are monospaced variants, by definition they cannot have any kerning. All letters in all combinations have a width of 6 pixels. That is different in the Prop variant. Letter combinations have their own kerning value, to optimize their spacing. In the design of Bitcount Prop all capital-capital combination have two pixels spacing, where capital-lowercase have a spacing of one pixel. This difference is solved by kerning.</p>

<img src="image14.png">

<p>As with spacing and tracking, all kerning is rounded to whole pixels. In traditional typographic spacing this may not always be exactly right, in the matrix-grid of Bitcount, the designed spacing is the “best possible”, given the limitations of the grid.</p>

<h4>Ascenders and descenders</h4>

<h5><em>Grid</em></h5>

<p>All letters in the Grid variant have a total height of not more than 7 pixels, one pixels for ascenders and one pixel for descenders. As it is impossible to express articulation in the shape of accents, they are all reduced to one or two pixels. The size of accented capitals it reduced to 5 pixels to accommodate the accent on top. This makes the capital shape identical to the small-caps. Here showing the accent letters “AÁÃaáã” using Grid and Mono on their grids of respectively 7 pixels and 10 pixel high.</p>

<img src="image15.png">

<h5><em>Mono and Prop</em></h5>

<p>In the Bitcount Mono and Prop variants capital, ascenders and descender heights can be extended using one or all of the stylistic OpenType Features Extended capital, Extended ascender and Extended descender.</p>

<img src="image16.png">

<p>Extending the capitals is made as a separate OT-feature, so the user can choose to make the capitals the same size as the ascenders (7 pixels), or use the set that is one pixels smaller (6 pixels).</p>

<img src="image17.png">

<h4>x-height and cap-height</h4>

<p>The standard x-height for all Bitcount variants is 5 pixels.</p>

<img src="image18.png">

<p>The smallest proportions can be found in the Grid variant. Lowercase letters are mostly made with a grid of 5 x 5 pixels. In the standard grid of 5 x 7, that leaves room for one pixel ascender and one pixel descender.</p>

<h4>Contrast and weight</h4>

<p>Due to the nature of pixel letter in such low resolution, there is almost no freedom to express contrast in letterforms. The difference between thick and thin areas comes from the distance between close horizontal adjacent pixels (darker) and the larger distance between diagonal pixels (lighter). Often this happens in places where the contrast should be the other way around.</p>
  
<p>Within the limitations of what is possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Single and Double</em> variants</li>
  <li>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</li>
  <li>Size and shape of pixels</li>
</ul>

<h5>Single and Double variants.</h5>

<p>Bitcount provides two ways of controlling the contrast. The variants Single and Double respectively have letters with one and two pixel stems. Although this difference can be interpreted and used as “Roman” and “Bold”, it is not necessarily the only usage. The Double (with more expression of the tick-thin relation on the right spot).</p>

<img src="image19.png">

<h4>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</h4>

<p>In Single variant there is an OT-Feature available to add a pixel where contrast is needed, especially in the diagonal connections. Of course this feature only works if there enough space, such as “O” and “C”.</p>

<img src="image20.png">

<p>In the Double variants is the feature selected by default. There the OT-Feature No contrast pixel is necessary to turn the contrast pixel off.</p>

<img src="image21.png">

<p>In the OT Feature Condensed selection, the extra contrast pixel is not available, due to the restriction of space.</p>

<h4>Size and shape of pixels</h4>

<p>The base package of Bitcount includes four sizes/weight for each unique pixel shape. There are five sizes of Circles (Light, Book, Regular, Medium and Bold) and there are five corresponding sizes of Square and Plus pixels. The Regular weight is by definition the size of pixels that exactly fit the grid of 100 units. Future releases of Bitcount packages will include more weights and shapes.</p>

<img src="image22.png">

<p>Due to the difference area coverage of Circles and Squares, their visual weight is not equal. This can also be used by the designer as an expression for typographic weight difference.</p>

<img src="image23.png">

<p>Within the range of similar pixels shapes the weights are relative. For the sake of consistency, the weight name refers to the size of the pixel, not the optical weight. This is best visible in the pixels where the inside is open. Here is an example of the Line Circle pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image24.png">

<p>And here is an example of the Line Square pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image25.png">

<p>Completing the types of pixels shapes in the basic package of Bitcount, this is the weight range of the Plus shape.</p>

<img src="image26.png">

<p>The line width and the size of all Plus pixels is adjusted to the size of the Line pixels. This gives the option to “cut” a cross from the other pixels, such as Line Circle and Square in multiple layers. Visualized in this animation of layers:</p>

<h4>Width</h4>

<p>The Single variants implement an OT-Feature Condensed that does display much of the glyph set as condensed. For the monospaced Grid and Mono variants this means that one pixel is added to the right side of each letter, to keep the same monospaced width of 6 pixels. But the optically wider spacing is not a problem, especially when used is small sizes.</p>

<img src="image27.png">

<p>For the Prop variant it means that the condensed letters are spaced one pixel more narrow than the monospaced.</p>

<img src="image28.png">

<h4>Italic</h4>

<p>In Bitcount a separation is made between the italic (slanted) angle of the stems (defined by the selection of the font style), and the italic shapes of letters (by selecting the OpenType Feature). This means that all 4 combination are available to the user.</p>

<img src="image29.png">

<p>An alternative “g” is available as OT-Feature, but due to the complexity of the shape at low resolution, it is not made default for upright-roman (as it could have been in a regular type design).</p>

<img src="image30.png">

<p>The Circle pixel shapes are not altered when slanted. But the Square pixels (and others with straight sides) are using slanted versions of the pixel shape to make the stems appear to be slanted.</p>

<img src="image31.png">

<h3>Glyph set</h3>

<h4>Small-caps</h4>

<p>Both OT-Feature Lowercase to small-caps and Captial to small-caps are implemented for all Bitcount variants.</p>

<p>Conversion with Lowercase to small-caps looks like this for the Mono Single variant:</p>

<img src="image32.png">

<p>And like this for the Prop Single variant:</p>

<img src="image33.png">

<p>Conversion with OT-Feature Capital to small-caps looks like this:</p>

<img src="image34.png">

<h5>Figures in Single</h5>

<p>Bitcount implements seven sets of figures for the Single variant and five sets for the Double variant. In the example image they are showing in order of:</p>

<p>Mono Single figures on fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image35.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Condensed).</p>

<img src="image36.png">

<p>Mono Single figures width extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image37.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Extended capitals and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image38.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase figures).</p>

<img src="image39.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase figures and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image40.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image41.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase to small-caps and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image42.png">

<p>Prop Single with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width. The use of fractions is limited in this low resolution of 2x4 pixels (where the only possible design option for the zero is two horizontal lines), but for completeness it is good to have the full characters set available in fonts like this. Also the readability of fractional figures is very much dependent on the context, the shape and size of the pixels. It is up to the designer to decide if usage is appropriate in a given situation.</p>

<img src="image43.png">

<p>Both Prop Single and Prop Double include the OT-feature tnum (table numbers), which will force the figures (and some related characters like valuta, period, and comma) to a fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image44.png">

<h4>Figures in Double</h4>

<p>As the Double does not have a Condensed OT-feature, there is only four sets of figures.</p>

<p>Mono Double figures on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image45.png">

<p>Mono Double figures width extended height on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image46.png">

<p>Mono Double small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image47.png">

<p>Prop Double with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width.</p>

<img src="image48.png">

<p>In all variant styles there are alternate slashed zeros available as OT-Feature zero.</p>

<img src="image49.png">

<h4>Matrix</h4>

<p>In case the full set of pixels is need (e.g. as a background layer with LED’s that are on/off), there are several matrices available when the OT feature Ligature is turned on. The availability of the matrix depends on the variant. In the illustration respectively are shown /matrix57, /matrix58, /matrix68, /matrix610. Also the TYPETR logo is available /typetr.</p>

<h3>OpenType Features</h3>

<p>Not all OpenType Features are available in every Bitcount variant. See the Reference for more details, specific per style.</p>

<h3>Bitcount</h3> 
    
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>Bitcount is a family of styles, where the core shape of letters has been reduced to the minimal number of pixels possible. We need at least 5 vertical pixels of x-height to draw “a” and “e”. Adding the minimum of 1 pixel as ascender and 1 pixel as descender, the minimum grid is 5 pixels wide and 7 pixel high. Here the <em>Bitcount Single Regular</em> is shown.</p>

<img src="image1.png">

<p>The large number of styles in the Bitcount family come from the virtually infinite amount of variations that are possible, even with this small amount of 35+ pixels. The styles vary in articulation of accent shapes, one or two pixel stems, roman or slanted, normal or condensed. And all of this with a range of pixels shapes, such as large/small circles and large/small squares. Here showing respectively <em>Bitcount Single Regular Circle, Bitcount Double Regular Circle and Bitcount Single Regular Square.</em></p>

<img src="image2.png">

<p>In order to find the best selection of styles for a specific task, this “manual” is available, illustrated with a large number of examples.</p>

<p>And even Python/DrawBot programs are available for users who want to dive into it to that level of detail. E.g. to create similar animations to the ones shown in this manual.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>There are many ways to use Bitcount. To name a few from practice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As decorative type design, e.g. by combining a number of layers, each with their own pixel shape, color and transparency.</li>
  <li>Layers can be used to simulate 3-D effects – suggesting shadow and globes with highlights – by not centering them on purpose.</li>
  <li>As type design for usage in hardware devices (such as running LED-displays) where there is very limited space, or if there is a fixed grid.</li>
  <li>As display type in very small sizes in very low resolution or as hard-core bitmap fonts, e.g. to build into low-resolution devices, such as displays and printers.</li>
  <li>As template for physical type, e.g. with LEGO bricks, flower-pots or lights behind a grid of windows in a building.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Decorative designs</h5>

<p>Since most of the Bitcount letters within the same variant (Grid, Mono, or Prop) have identical spacing, they can be used in overlapping layers to create colorful decorative type.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Multiple layers of Bitcount generate an infinite amount of pixels shape combinations.</p>

<p>The animated examples give fast overview of possible combination, in plain or transparent colors.</p>

<img src="image4.png">

<p>For a whole letter this would look like this:</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image5.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Here is an overview of 3 random layers. Each of these combinations can be used as pixel shape for any layer combination of Bitcount letters.</p>

<h4>Running LED-displays</h4>

<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Grid Double</em> with fixed height in 7 pixel grid display and fixed monospaced width of 6 pixels. Note the use of <em>Bitcount Grid Double Italic</em> to simulate the slanted delay of electronics in physical LED-displays with running text.</p>

<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Prop Single</em> with height of 10 pixels, with extended ascenders and descenders (by OpenType Features) and proportional spacing. Also here, <em>Bitcount Prop Single Italic</em> is used to slant the running text.</p>

<h4>Low resolution screens</h4>

<p>Weight variations can be made by altering the pixel size (or intensity), instead of adding more pixels. Although the 2-pixel contrast stem of the Double variant in this example could be interpreted as bold, it is compensated by using very small or light pixels.</p>

<img src="image9.png">

<h3>Overview of typographic values</h3>

<h4>Spacing</h4>

<p>There are three spacing variants in the Bitcount family: Grid, Mono and Prop. The variants Grid and Mono are “monospaced”, all letters have the same width of 6 pixels. Since letters as “l” and “i” normally need less spacing, the fixed width is bridged by adding serifs where necessary, although the basics of Bitcount is sans-serif. In the Prop variant all letters have their own widths, dependent on the space they need, but all widths are rounded to whole pixels distances.</p>

<img src="image12.png">

<h4>Tracking</h4>

<p>The internal measures of the font is defined in a way that it is easy to measure. Each pixel has a distance of 100 units of the total 1000 units of the Em-square. This means that the width of a pixel (and thus of the spacing) is 1/10 of the font size. This way tracking can be calculated. For each extra pixel to the spacing of letters, Adobe InDesign needs a tracking of 10.</p>

<img src="image13.png">

<h4>Kerning</h4>

<p>Since the Grid and Mono are monospaced variants, by definition they cannot have any kerning. All letters in all combinations have a width of 6 pixels. That is different in the Prop variant. Letter combinations have their own kerning value, to optimize their spacing. In the design of Bitcount Prop all capital-capital combination have two pixels spacing, where capital-lowercase have a spacing of one pixel. This difference is solved by kerning.</p>

<img src="image14.png">

<p>As with spacing and tracking, all kerning is rounded to whole pixels. In traditional typographic spacing this may not always be exactly right, in the matrix-grid of Bitcount, the designed spacing is the “best possible”, given the limitations of the grid.</p>

<h4>Ascenders and descenders</h4>

<h5><em>Grid</em></h5>

<p>All letters in the Grid variant have a total height of not more than 7 pixels, one pixels for ascenders and one pixel for descenders. As it is impossible to express articulation in the shape of accents, they are all reduced to one or two pixels. The size of accented capitals it reduced to 5 pixels to accommodate the accent on top. This makes the capital shape identical to the small-caps. Here showing the accent letters “AÁÃaáã” using Grid and Mono on their grids of respectively 7 pixels and 10 pixel high.</p>

<img src="image15.png">

<h5><em>Mono and Prop</em></h5>

<p>In the Bitcount Mono and Prop variants capital, ascenders and descender heights can be extended using one or all of the stylistic OpenType Features Extended capital, Extended ascender and Extended descender.</p>

<img src="image16.png">

<p>Extending the capitals is made as a separate OT-feature, so the user can choose to make the capitals the same size as the ascenders (7 pixels), or use the set that is one pixels smaller (6 pixels).</p>

<img src="image17.png">

<h4>x-height and cap-height</h4>

<p>The standard x-height for all Bitcount variants is 5 pixels.</p>

<img src="image18.png">

<p>The smallest proportions can be found in the Grid variant. Lowercase letters are mostly made with a grid of 5 x 5 pixels. In the standard grid of 5 x 7, that leaves room for one pixel ascender and one pixel descender.</p>

<h4>Contrast and weight</h4>

<p>Due to the nature of pixel letter in such low resolution, there is almost no freedom to express contrast in letterforms. The difference between thick and thin areas comes from the distance between close horizontal adjacent pixels (darker) and the larger distance between diagonal pixels (lighter). Often this happens in places where the contrast should be the other way around.</p>
  
<p>Within the limitations of what is possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Single and Double</em> variants</li>
  <li>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</li>
  <li>Size and shape of pixels</li>
</ul>

<h5>Single and Double variants.</h5>

<p>Bitcount provides two ways of controlling the contrast. The variants Single and Double respectively have letters with one and two pixel stems. Although this difference can be interpreted and used as “Roman” and “Bold”, it is not necessarily the only usage. The Double (with more expression of the tick-thin relation on the right spot).</p>

<img src="image19.png">

<h4>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</h4>

<p>In Single variant there is an OT-Feature available to add a pixel where contrast is needed, especially in the diagonal connections. Of course this feature only works if there enough space, such as “O” and “C”.</p>

<img src="image20.png">

<p>In the Double variants is the feature selected by default. There the OT-Feature No contrast pixel is necessary to turn the contrast pixel off.</p>

<img src="image21.png">

<p>In the OT Feature Condensed selection, the extra contrast pixel is not available, due to the restriction of space.</p>

<h4>Size and shape of pixels</h4>

<p>The base package of Bitcount includes four sizes/weight for each unique pixel shape. There are five sizes of Circles (Light, Book, Regular, Medium and Bold) and there are five corresponding sizes of Square and Plus pixels. The Regular weight is by definition the size of pixels that exactly fit the grid of 100 units. Future releases of Bitcount packages will include more weights and shapes.</p>

<img src="image22.png">

<p>Due to the difference area coverage of Circles and Squares, their visual weight is not equal. This can also be used by the designer as an expression for typographic weight difference.</p>

<img src="image23.png">

<p>Within the range of similar pixels shapes the weights are relative. For the sake of consistency, the weight name refers to the size of the pixel, not the optical weight. This is best visible in the pixels where the inside is open. Here is an example of the Line Circle pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image24.png">

<p>And here is an example of the Line Square pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image25.png">

<p>Completing the types of pixels shapes in the basic package of Bitcount, this is the weight range of the Plus shape.</p>

<img src="image26.png">

<p>The line width and the size of all Plus pixels is adjusted to the size of the Line pixels. This gives the option to “cut” a cross from the other pixels, such as Line Circle and Square in multiple layers. Visualized in this animation of layers:</p>

<h4>Width</h4>

<p>The Single variants implement an OT-Feature Condensed that does display much of the glyph set as condensed. For the monospaced Grid and Mono variants this means that one pixel is added to the right side of each letter, to keep the same monospaced width of 6 pixels. But the optically wider spacing is not a problem, especially when used is small sizes.</p>

<img src="image27.png">

<p>For the Prop variant it means that the condensed letters are spaced one pixel more narrow than the monospaced.</p>

<img src="image28.png">

<h4>Italic</h4>

<p>In Bitcount a separation is made between the italic (slanted) angle of the stems (defined by the selection of the font style), and the italic shapes of letters (by selecting the OpenType Feature). This means that all 4 combination are available to the user.</p>

<img src="image29.png">

<p>An alternative “g” is available as OT-Feature, but due to the complexity of the shape at low resolution, it is not made default for upright-roman (as it could have been in a regular type design).</p>

<img src="image30.png">

<p>The Circle pixel shapes are not altered when slanted. But the Square pixels (and others with straight sides) are using slanted versions of the pixel shape to make the stems appear to be slanted.</p>

<img src="image31.png">

<h3>Glyph set</h3>

<h4>Small-caps</h4>

<p>Both OT-Feature Lowercase to small-caps and Captial to small-caps are implemented for all Bitcount variants.</p>

<p>Conversion with Lowercase to small-caps looks like this for the Mono Single variant:</p>

<img src="image32.png">

<p>And like this for the Prop Single variant:</p>

<img src="image33.png">

<p>Conversion with OT-Feature Capital to small-caps looks like this:</p>

<img src="image34.png">

<h5>Figures in Single</h5>

<p>Bitcount implements seven sets of figures for the Single variant and five sets for the Double variant. In the example image they are showing in order of:</p>

<p>Mono Single figures on fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image35.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Condensed).</p>

<img src="image36.png">

<p>Mono Single figures width extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image37.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Extended capitals and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image38.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase figures).</p>

<img src="image39.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase figures and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image40.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image41.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase to small-caps and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image42.png">

<p>Prop Single with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width. The use of fractions is limited in this low resolution of 2x4 pixels (where the only possible design option for the zero is two horizontal lines), but for completeness it is good to have the full characters set available in fonts like this. Also the readability of fractional figures is very much dependent on the context, the shape and size of the pixels. It is up to the designer to decide if usage is appropriate in a given situation.</p>

<img src="image43.png">

<p>Both Prop Single and Prop Double include the OT-feature tnum (table numbers), which will force the figures (and some related characters like valuta, period, and comma) to a fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image44.png">

<h4>Figures in Double</h4>

<p>As the Double does not have a Condensed OT-feature, there is only four sets of figures.</p>

<p>Mono Double figures on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image45.png">

<p>Mono Double figures width extended height on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image46.png">

<p>Mono Double small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image47.png">

<p>Prop Double with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width.</p>

<img src="image48.png">

<p>In all variant styles there are alternate slashed zeros available as OT-Feature zero.</p>

<img src="image49.png">

<h4>Matrix</h4>

<p>In case the full set of pixels is need (e.g. as a background layer with LED’s that are on/off), there are several matrices available when the OT feature Ligature is turned on. The availability of the matrix depends on the variant. In the illustration respectively are shown /matrix57, /matrix58, /matrix68, /matrix610. Also the TYPETR logo is available /typetr.</p>

<img src="image50.png">

<h3>OpenType Features</h3>

<p>Not all OpenType Features are available in every Bitcount variant. See the Reference for more details, specific per style.</p>

<h3>The Making of Bitcount</h3>

<p>The Bitcount project started in the late 70’s as an experiment to find the minimum amount of pixels necessary to define a full set of ASCII characters. Mainstream as that may seem today, it wasn’t at that time.</p>

<img src="image51.png">

<p>In the seventies, digital typefaces for printing were hidden deep inside commercial typesetting machines (starting as scanned photo negatives, not even as digital outline information). Or they were stored as bitmap in terminal screens. Resolution and speed were costly resources, so the bitmap was hardcoded into the screen electronics, often just for one size.</p>

<p>It was the general convention at that time, that for Latin, at least 9 pixels where necessary to make a clear distinction between ascenders (7), capitals (6), lowercase (5), and descenders (2). Furthermore, all letters
needed to be monospaced, because there was no way pixels could be stored as in modern graphic screens. The shapes were generated by hardware during the sweep of scan-lines of the television screen. Proportional spacing would have added a lot more costly hardware.</p>

<p>The design of these pixel grids was exclusively the domain of engineering: Take a matrix and add pixels until it can be recognized as an “n”. The problem with this approach is that “contrast” seems like luxury, not worth considering (if such a thing was considered at all). The stems of such an “n” have a width of one pixel, vertical and horizontal equally spaced. But simple mathematics shows that if the horizontal distance between pixels is 1, the diagonal distance between points is 1.41, showing as a lighter area in the letter. The problem is in the resulting contrast in the diagonals.</p>

<img src="image52.png">

<p>This is not a problem where bows run in to stems, but on the top-right of the “n” it is a problem, because that is traditionally the darkest part of the letter shape. The contrast makes the difference between “n” and “h” 3 pixels, instead of the traditional one pixel. This compensates for the relative small ascender length of only one pixel.</p>

<img src="image53.png">

<p>Early sketches of the 5 x 7 pixel grid show that even in a small design space of 35 pixels, the number of different options is enormous. Note the various alternatives for the “m”, to make it fit in the impossible width of 5 pixels. It is common understanding in design, that what first seems to be an extreme reduction of design options, in reality still needs a design process to find the best choice. Or to create alternative solutions that work just as well or better.</p>
<p>Bitcount is perfect for creating layered typographic effects using different colors and font styles. A slight shift in position creates shadows, highlights, and 3D effects. If you want to reproduce a certain combination on your own site, download Bitcount, copy the HTML/CSS, and integrate the code into your site. Or just keep playing!</p>

<h3>Bitcount</h3> 
    
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>Bitcount is a family of styles, where the core shape of letters has been reduced to the minimal number of pixels possible. We need at least 5 vertical pixels of x-height to draw “a” and “e”. Adding the minimum of 1 pixel as ascender and 1 pixel as descender, the minimum grid is 5 pixels wide and 7 pixel high. Here the <em>Bitcount Single Regular</em> is shown.</p>

<img src="image1.png">

<p>The large number of styles in the Bitcount family come from the virtually infinite amount of variations that are possible, even with this small amount of 35+ pixels. The styles vary in articulation of accent shapes, one or two pixel stems, roman or slanted, normal or condensed. And all of this with a range of pixels shapes, such as large/small circles and large/small squares. Here showing respectively <em>Bitcount Single Regular Circle, Bitcount Double Regular Circle and Bitcount Single Regular Square.</em></p>

<img src="image2.png">

<p>In order to find the best selection of styles for a specific task, this “manual” is available, illustrated with a large number of examples.</p>

<p>And even Python/DrawBot programs are available for users who want to dive into it to that level of detail. E.g. to create similar animations to the ones shown in this manual.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>There are many ways to use Bitcount. To name a few from practice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As decorative type design, e.g. by combining a number of layers, each with their own pixel shape, color and transparency.</li>
  <li>Layers can be used to simulate 3-D effects – suggesting shadow and globes with highlights – by not centering them on purpose.</li>
  <li>As type design for usage in hardware devices (such as running LED-displays) where there is very limited space, or if there is a fixed grid.</li>
  <li>As display type in very small sizes in very low resolution or as hard-core bitmap fonts, e.g. to build into low-resolution devices, such as displays and printers.</li>
  <li>As template for physical type, e.g. with LEGO bricks, flower-pots or lights behind a grid of windows in a building.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Decorative designs</h5>

<p>Since most of the Bitcount letters within the same variant (Grid, Mono, or Prop) have identical spacing, they can be used in overlapping layers to create colorful decorative type.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Multiple layers of Bitcount generate an infinite amount of pixels shape combinations.</p>

<p>The animated examples give fast overview of possible combination, in plain or transparent colors.</p>

<img src="image4.png">

<p>For a whole letter this would look like this:</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image5.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Here is an overview of 3 random layers. Each of these combinations can be used as pixel shape for any layer combination of Bitcount letters.</p>

<img src="image6.png">

<h4>Running LED-displays</h4>

<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Grid Double</em> with fixed height in 7 pixel grid display and fixed monospaced width of 6 pixels. Note the use of <em>Bitcount Grid Double Italic</em> to simulate the slanted delay of electronics in physical LED-displays with running text.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image7.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Prop Single</em> with height of 10 pixels, with extended ascenders and descenders (by OpenType Features) and proportional spacing. Also here, <em>Bitcount Prop Single Italic</em> is used to slant the running text.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image8.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<h4>Low resolution screens</h4>

<p>Weight variations can be made by altering the pixel size (or intensity), instead of adding more pixels. Although the 2-pixel contrast stem of the Double variant in this example could be interpreted as bold, it is compensated by using very small or light pixels.</p>

<img src="image9.png">

<h3>Overview of typographic values</h3>

<h4>Spacing</h4>

<p>There are three spacing variants in the Bitcount family: Grid, Mono and Prop. The variants Grid and Mono are “monospaced”, all letters have the same width of 6 pixels. Since letters as “l” and “i” normally need less spacing, the fixed width is bridged by adding serifs where necessary, although the basics of Bitcount is sans-serif. In the Prop variant all letters have their own widths, dependent on the space they need, but all widths are rounded to whole pixels distances.</p>

<img src="image12.png">

<h4>Tracking</h4>

<p>The internal measures of the font is defined in a way that it is easy to measure. Each pixel has a distance of 100 units of the total 1000 units of the Em-square. This means that the width of a pixel (and thus of the spacing) is 1/10 of the font size. This way tracking can be calculated. For each extra pixel to the spacing of letters, Adobe InDesign needs a tracking of 10.</p>

<img src="image13.png">

<h4>Kerning</h4>

<p>Since the Grid and Mono are monospaced variants, by definition they cannot have any kerning. All letters in all combinations have a width of 6 pixels. That is different in the Prop variant. Letter combinations have their own kerning value, to optimize their spacing. In the design of Bitcount Prop all capital-capital combination have two pixels spacing, where capital-lowercase have a spacing of one pixel. This difference is solved by kerning.</p>

<img src="image14.png">

<p>As with spacing and tracking, all kerning is rounded to whole pixels. In traditional typographic spacing this may not always be exactly right, in the matrix-grid of Bitcount, the designed spacing is the “best possible”, given the limitations of the grid.</p>

<h4>Ascenders and descenders</h4>

<h5><em>Grid</em></h5>

<p>All letters in the Grid variant have a total height of not more than 7 pixels, one pixels for ascenders and one pixel for descenders. As it is impossible to express articulation in the shape of accents, they are all reduced to one or two pixels. The size of accented capitals it reduced to 5 pixels to accommodate the accent on top. This makes the capital shape identical to the small-caps. Here showing the accent letters “AÁÃaáã” using Grid and Mono on their grids of respectively 7 pixels and 10 pixel high.</p>

<img src="image15.png">

<h5><em>Mono and Prop</em></h5>

<p>In the Bitcount Mono and Prop variants capital, ascenders and descender heights can be extended using one or all of the stylistic OpenType Features Extended capital, Extended ascender and Extended descender.</p>

<img src="image16.png">

<p>Extending the capitals is made as a separate OT-feature, so the user can choose to make the capitals the same size as the ascenders (7 pixels), or use the set that is one pixels smaller (6 pixels).</p>

<img src="image17.png">

<h4>x-height and cap-height</h4>

<p>The standard x-height for all Bitcount variants is 5 pixels.</p>

<img src="image18.png">

<p>The smallest proportions can be found in the Grid variant. Lowercase letters are mostly made with a grid of 5 x 5 pixels. In the standard grid of 5 x 7, that leaves room for one pixel ascender and one pixel descender.</p>

<h4>Contrast and weight</h4>

<p>Due to the nature of pixel letter in such low resolution, there is almost no freedom to express contrast in letterforms. The difference between thick and thin areas comes from the distance between close horizontal adjacent pixels (darker) and the larger distance between diagonal pixels (lighter). Often this happens in places where the contrast should be the other way around.</p>
  
<p>Within the limitations of what is possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Single and Double</em> variants</li>
  <li>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</li>
  <li>Size and shape of pixels</li>
</ul>

<h5>Single and Double variants.</h5>

<p>Bitcount provides two ways of controlling the contrast. The variants Single and Double respectively have letters with one and two pixel stems. Although this difference can be interpreted and used as “Roman” and “Bold”, it is not necessarily the only usage. The Double (with more expression of the tick-thin relation on the right spot).</p>

<img src="image19.png">

<h4>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</h4>

<p>In Single variant there is an OT-Feature available to add a pixel where contrast is needed, especially in the diagonal connections. Of course this feature only works if there enough space, such as “O” and “C”.</p>

<img src="image20.png">

<p>In the Double variants is the feature selected by default. There the OT-Feature No contrast pixel is necessary to turn the contrast pixel off.</p>

<img src="image21.png">

<p>In the OT Feature Condensed selection, the extra contrast pixel is not available, due to the restriction of space.</p>

<h4>Size and shape of pixels</h4>

<p>The base package of Bitcount includes four sizes/weight for each unique pixel shape. There are five sizes of Circles (Light, Book, Regular, Medium and Bold) and there are five corresponding sizes of Square and Plus pixels. The Regular weight is by definition the size of pixels that exactly fit the grid of 100 units. Future releases of Bitcount packages will include more weights and shapes.</p>

<img src="image22.png">

<p>Due to the difference area coverage of Circles and Squares, their visual weight is not equal. This can also be used by the designer as an expression for typographic weight difference.</p>

<img src="image23.png">

<p>Within the range of similar pixels shapes the weights are relative. For the sake of consistency, the weight name refers to the size of the pixel, not the optical weight. This is best visible in the pixels where the inside is open. Here is an example of the Line Circle pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image24.png">

<p>And here is an example of the Line Square pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image25.png">

<p>Completing the types of pixels shapes in the basic package of Bitcount, this is the weight range of the Plus shape.</p>

<img src="image26.png">

<p>The line width and the size of all Plus pixels is adjusted to the size of the Line pixels. This gives the option to “cut” a cross from the other pixels, such as Line Circle and Square in multiple layers. Visualized in this animation of layers:</p>

<h4>Width</h4>

<p>The Single variants implement an OT-Feature Condensed that does display much of the glyph set as condensed. For the monospaced Grid and Mono variants this means that one pixel is added to the right side of each letter, to keep the same monospaced width of 6 pixels. But the optically wider spacing is not a problem, especially when used is small sizes.</p>

<img src="image27.png">

<p>For the Prop variant it means that the condensed letters are spaced one pixel more narrow than the monospaced.</p>

<img src="image28.png">

<h4>Italic</h4>

<p>In Bitcount a separation is made between the italic (slanted) angle of the stems (defined by the selection of the font style), and the italic shapes of letters (by selecting the OpenType Feature). This means that all 4 combination are available to the user.</p>

<img src="image29.png">

<p>An alternative “g” is available as OT-Feature, but due to the complexity of the shape at low resolution, it is not made default for upright-roman (as it could have been in a regular type design).</p>

<img src="image30.png">

<p>The Circle pixel shapes are not altered when slanted. But the Square pixels (and others with straight sides) are using slanted versions of the pixel shape to make the stems appear to be slanted.</p>

<img src="image31.png">

<h3>Glyph set</h3>

<h4>Small-caps</h4>

<p>Both OT-Feature Lowercase to small-caps and Captial to small-caps are implemented for all Bitcount variants.</p>

<p>Conversion with Lowercase to small-caps looks like this for the Mono Single variant:</p>

<img src="image32.png">

<p>And like this for the Prop Single variant:</p>

<img src="image33.png">

<p>Conversion with OT-Feature Capital to small-caps looks like this:</p>

<img src="image34.png">

<h5>Figures in Single</h5>

<p>Bitcount implements seven sets of figures for the Single variant and five sets for the Double variant. In the example image they are showing in order of:</p>

<p>Mono Single figures on fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image35.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Condensed).</p>

<img src="image36.png">

<p>Mono Single figures width extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image37.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Extended capitals and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image38.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase figures).</p>

<img src="image39.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase figures and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image40.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image41.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase to small-caps and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image42.png">

<p>Prop Single with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width. The use of fractions is limited in this low resolution of 2x4 pixels (where the only possible design option for the zero is two horizontal lines), but for completeness it is good to have the full characters set available in fonts like this. Also the readability of fractional figures is very much dependent on the context, the shape and size of the pixels. It is up to the designer to decide if usage is appropriate in a given situation.</p>

<img src="image43.png">

<p>Both Prop Single and Prop Double include the OT-feature tnum (table numbers), which will force the figures (and some related characters like valuta, period, and comma) to a fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image44.png">

<h4>Figures in Double</h4>

<p>As the Double does not have a Condensed OT-feature, there is only four sets of figures.</p>

<p>Mono Double figures on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image45.png">

<p>Mono Double figures width extended height on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image46.png">

<p>Mono Double small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image47.png">

<p>Prop Double with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width.</p>

<img src="image48.png">

<p>In all variant styles there are alternate slashed zeros available as OT-Feature zero.</p>

<img src="image49.png">

<h4>Matrix</h4>

<p>In case the full set of pixels is need (e.g. as a background layer with LED’s that are on/off), there are several matrices available when the OT feature Ligature is turned on. The availability of the matrix depends on the variant. In the illustration respectively are shown /matrix57, /matrix58, /matrix68, /matrix610. Also the TYPETR logo is available /typetr.</p>

<img src="image50.png">

<h3>OpenType Features</h3>

<p>Not all OpenType Features are available in every Bitcount variant. See the Reference for more details, specific per style.</p>

<h3>The Making of Bitcount</h3>

<p>The Bitcount project started in the late 70’s as an experiment to find the minimum amount of pixels necessary to define a full set of ASCII characters. Mainstream as that may seem today, it wasn’t at that time.</p>

<img src="image51.png">

<p>In the seventies, digital typefaces for printing were hidden deep inside commercial typesetting machines (starting as scanned photo negatives, not even as digital outline information). Or they were stored as bitmap in terminal screens. Resolution and speed were costly resources, so the bitmap was hardcoded into the screen electronics, often just for one size.</p>

<p>It was the general convention at that time, that for Latin, at least 9 pixels where necessary to make a clear distinction between ascenders (7), capitals (6), lowercase (5), and descenders (2). Furthermore, all letters
needed to be monospaced, because there was no way pixels could be stored as in modern graphic screens. The shapes were generated by hardware during the sweep of scan-lines of the television screen. Proportional spacing would have added a lot more costly hardware.</p>

<p>The design of these pixel grids was exclusively the domain of engineering: Take a matrix and add pixels until it can be recognized as an “n”. The problem with this approach is that “contrast” seems like luxury, not worth considering (if such a thing was considered at all). The stems of such an “n” have a width of one pixel, vertical and horizontal equally spaced. But simple mathematics shows that if the horizontal distance between pixels is 1, the diagonal distance between points is 1.41, showing as a lighter area in the letter. The problem is in the resulting contrast in the diagonals.</p>

<img src="image52.png">

<p>This is not a problem where bows run in to stems, but on the top-right of the “n” it is a problem, because that is traditionally the darkest part of the letter shape. The contrast makes the difference between “n” and “h” 3 pixels, instead of the traditional one pixel. This compensates for the relative small ascender length of only one pixel.</p>

<img src="image53.png">

<p>Early sketches of the 5 x 7 pixel grid show that even in a small design space of 35 pixels, the number of different options is enormous. Note the various alternatives for the “m”, to make it fit in the impossible width of 5 pixels. It is common understanding in design, that what first seems to be an extreme reduction of design options, in reality still needs a design process to find the best choice. Or to create alternative solutions that work just as well or better.</p>
<p>Bitcount is perfect for creating layered typographic effects using different colors and font styles. A slight shift in position creates shadows, highlights, and 3D effects. If you want to reproduce a certain combination on your own site, download Bitcount, copy the HTML/CSS, and integrate the code into your site. Or just keep playing!</p>

<h3>Bitcount</h3> 
    
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>Bitcount is a family of styles, where the core shape of letters has been reduced to the minimal number of pixels possible. We need at least 5 vertical pixels of x-height to draw “a” and “e”. Adding the minimum of 1 pixel as ascender and 1 pixel as descender, the minimum grid is 5 pixels wide and 7 pixel high. Here the <em>Bitcount Single Regular</em> is shown.</p>

<img src="image1.png">

<p>The large number of styles in the Bitcount family come from the virtually infinite amount of variations that are possible, even with this small amount of 35+ pixels. The styles vary in articulation of accent shapes, one or two pixel stems, roman or slanted, normal or condensed. And all of this with a range of pixels shapes, such as large/small circles and large/small squares. Here showing respectively <em>Bitcount Single Regular Circle, Bitcount Double Regular Circle and Bitcount Single Regular Square.</em></p>

<img src="image2.png">

<p>In order to find the best selection of styles for a specific task, this “manual” is available, illustrated with a large number of examples.</p>

<p>And even Python/DrawBot programs are available for users who want to dive into it to that level of detail. E.g. to create similar animations to the ones shown in this manual.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>There are many ways to use Bitcount. To name a few from practice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As decorative type design, e.g. by combining a number of layers, each with their own pixel shape, color and transparency.</li>
  <li>Layers can be used to simulate 3-D effects – suggesting shadow and globes with highlights – by not centering them on purpose.</li>
  <li>As type design for usage in hardware devices (such as running LED-displays) where there is very limited space, or if there is a fixed grid.</li>
  <li>As display type in very small sizes in very low resolution or as hard-core bitmap fonts, e.g. to build into low-resolution devices, such as displays and printers.</li>
  <li>As template for physical type, e.g. with LEGO bricks, flower-pots or lights behind a grid of windows in a building.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Decorative designs</h5>

<p>Since most of the Bitcount letters within the same variant (Grid, Mono, or Prop) have identical spacing, they can be used in overlapping layers to create colorful decorative type.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Multiple layers of Bitcount generate an infinite amount of pixels shape combinations.</p>

<p>The animated examples give fast overview of possible combination, in plain or transparent colors.</p>

<img src="image4.png">

<p>For a whole letter this would look like this:</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image5.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Here is an overview of 3 random layers. Each of these combinations can be used as pixel shape for any layer combination of Bitcount letters.</p>

<img src="image6.png">

<h4>Running LED-displays</h4>

<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Grid Double</em> with fixed height in 7 pixel grid display and fixed monospaced width of 6 pixels. Note the use of <em>Bitcount Grid Double Italic</em> to simulate the slanted delay of electronics in physical LED-displays with running text.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image7.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


<p>Example of <em>Bitcount Prop Single</em> with height of 10 pixels, with extended ascenders and descenders (by OpenType Features) and proportional spacing. Also here, <em>Bitcount Prop Single Italic</em> is used to slant the running text.</p>

<video autoplay muted loop src="image8.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<h4>Low resolution screens</h4>

<p>Weight variations can be made by altering the pixel size (or intensity), instead of adding more pixels. Although the 2-pixel contrast stem of the Double variant in this example could be interpreted as bold, it is compensated by using very small or light pixels.</p>

<img src="image9.png">

<h3>Overview of typographic values</h3>

<h4>Spacing</h4>

<p>There are three spacing variants in the Bitcount family: Grid, Mono and Prop. The variants Grid and Mono are “monospaced”, all letters have the same width of 6 pixels. Since letters as “l” and “i” normally need less spacing, the fixed width is bridged by adding serifs where necessary, although the basics of Bitcount is sans-serif. In the Prop variant all letters have their own widths, dependent on the space they need, but all widths are rounded to whole pixels distances.</p>

<img src="image12.png">

<h4>Tracking</h4>

<p>The internal measures of the font is defined in a way that it is easy to measure. Each pixel has a distance of 100 units of the total 1000 units of the Em-square. This means that the width of a pixel (and thus of the spacing) is 1/10 of the font size. This way tracking can be calculated. For each extra pixel to the spacing of letters, Adobe InDesign needs a tracking of 10.</p>

<img src="image13.png">

<h4>Kerning</h4>

<p>Since the Grid and Mono are monospaced variants, by definition they cannot have any kerning. All letters in all combinations have a width of 6 pixels. That is different in the Prop variant. Letter combinations have their own kerning value, to optimize their spacing. In the design of Bitcount Prop all capital-capital combination have two pixels spacing, where capital-lowercase have a spacing of one pixel. This difference is solved by kerning.</p>

<img src="image14.png">

<p>As with spacing and tracking, all kerning is rounded to whole pixels. In traditional typographic spacing this may not always be exactly right, in the matrix-grid of Bitcount, the designed spacing is the “best possible”, given the limitations of the grid.</p>

<h4>Ascenders and descenders</h4>

<h5><em>Grid</em></h5>

<p>All letters in the Grid variant have a total height of not more than 7 pixels, one pixels for ascenders and one pixel for descenders. As it is impossible to express articulation in the shape of accents, they are all reduced to one or two pixels. The size of accented capitals it reduced to 5 pixels to accommodate the accent on top. This makes the capital shape identical to the small-caps. Here showing the accent letters “AÁÃaáã” using Grid and Mono on their grids of respectively 7 pixels and 10 pixel high.</p>

<img src="image15.png">

<h5><em>Mono and Prop</em></h5>

<p>In the Bitcount Mono and Prop variants capital, ascenders and descender heights can be extended using one or all of the stylistic OpenType Features Extended capital, Extended ascender and Extended descender.</p>

<img src="image16.png">

<p>Extending the capitals is made as a separate OT-feature, so the user can choose to make the capitals the same size as the ascenders (7 pixels), or use the set that is one pixels smaller (6 pixels).</p>

<img src="image17.png">

<h4>x-height and cap-height</h4>

<p>The standard x-height for all Bitcount variants is 5 pixels.</p>

<img src="image18.png">

<p>The smallest proportions can be found in the Grid variant. Lowercase letters are mostly made with a grid of 5 x 5 pixels. In the standard grid of 5 x 7, that leaves room for one pixel ascender and one pixel descender.</p>

<h4>Contrast and weight</h4>

<p>Due to the nature of pixel letter in such low resolution, there is almost no freedom to express contrast in letterforms. The difference between thick and thin areas comes from the distance between close horizontal adjacent pixels (darker) and the larger distance between diagonal pixels (lighter). Often this happens in places where the contrast should be the other way around.</p>
  
<p>Within the limitations of what is possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Single and Double</em> variants</li>
  <li>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</li>
  <li>Size and shape of pixels</li>
</ul>

<h5>Single and Double variants.</h5>

<p>Bitcount provides two ways of controlling the contrast. The variants Single and Double respectively have letters with one and two pixel stems. Although this difference can be interpreted and used as “Roman” and “Bold”, it is not necessarily the only usage. The Double (with more expression of the tick-thin relation on the right spot).</p>

<img src="image19.png">

<h4>OT-Feature Contrast pixel</h4>

<p>In Single variant there is an OT-Feature available to add a pixel where contrast is needed, especially in the diagonal connections. Of course this feature only works if there enough space, such as “O” and “C”.</p>

<img src="image20.png">

<p>In the Double variants is the feature selected by default. There the OT-Feature No contrast pixel is necessary to turn the contrast pixel off.</p>

<img src="image21.png">

<p>In the OT Feature Condensed selection, the extra contrast pixel is not available, due to the restriction of space.</p>

<h4>Size and shape of pixels</h4>

<p>The base package of Bitcount includes four sizes/weight for each unique pixel shape. There are five sizes of Circles (Light, Book, Regular, Medium and Bold) and there are five corresponding sizes of Square and Plus pixels. The Regular weight is by definition the size of pixels that exactly fit the grid of 100 units. Future releases of Bitcount packages will include more weights and shapes.</p>

<img src="image22.png">

<p>Due to the difference area coverage of Circles and Squares, their visual weight is not equal. This can also be used by the designer as an expression for typographic weight difference.</p>

<img src="image23.png">

<p>Within the range of similar pixels shapes the weights are relative. For the sake of consistency, the weight name refers to the size of the pixel, not the optical weight. This is best visible in the pixels where the inside is open. Here is an example of the Line Circle pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image24.png">

<p>And here is an example of the Line Square pixel variant by weight.</p>

<img src="image25.png">

<p>Completing the types of pixels shapes in the basic package of Bitcount, this is the weight range of the Plus shape.</p>

<img src="image26.png">

<p>The line width and the size of all Plus pixels is adjusted to the size of the Line pixels. This gives the option to “cut” a cross from the other pixels, such as Line Circle and Square in multiple layers. Visualized in this animation of layers:</p>

<h4>Width</h4>

<p>The Single variants implement an OT-Feature Condensed that does display much of the glyph set as condensed. For the monospaced Grid and Mono variants this means that one pixel is added to the right side of each letter, to keep the same monospaced width of 6 pixels. But the optically wider spacing is not a problem, especially when used is small sizes.</p>

<img src="image27.png">

<p>For the Prop variant it means that the condensed letters are spaced one pixel more narrow than the monospaced.</p>

<img src="image28.png">

<h4>Italic</h4>

<p>In Bitcount a separation is made between the italic (slanted) angle of the stems (defined by the selection of the font style), and the italic shapes of letters (by selecting the OpenType Feature). This means that all 4 combination are available to the user.</p>

<img src="image29.png">

<p>An alternative “g” is available as OT-Feature, but due to the complexity of the shape at low resolution, it is not made default for upright-roman (as it could have been in a regular type design).</p>

<img src="image30.png">

<p>The Circle pixel shapes are not altered when slanted. But the Square pixels (and others with straight sides) are using slanted versions of the pixel shape to make the stems appear to be slanted.</p>

<img src="image31.png">

<h3>Glyph set</h3>

<h4>Small-caps</h4>

<p>Both OT-Feature Lowercase to small-caps and Captial to small-caps are implemented for all Bitcount variants.</p>

<p>Conversion with Lowercase to small-caps looks like this for the Mono Single variant:</p>

<img src="image32.png">

<p>And like this for the Prop Single variant:</p>

<img src="image33.png">

<p>Conversion with OT-Feature Capital to small-caps looks like this:</p>

<img src="image34.png">

<h5>Figures in Single</h5>

<p>Bitcount implements seven sets of figures for the Single variant and five sets for the Double variant. In the example image they are showing in order of:</p>

<p>Mono Single figures on fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image35.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Condensed).</p>

<img src="image36.png">

<p>Mono Single figures width extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image37.png">

<p>Mono Single condensed figures extended height on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Extended capitals and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image38.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase figures).</p>

<img src="image39.png">

<p>Mono Single lowercase figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase figures and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image40.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image41.png">

<p>Mono Single small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature combination Lowercase to small-caps and Condensed).</p>

<img src="image42.png">

<p>Prop Single with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width. The use of fractions is limited in this low resolution of 2x4 pixels (where the only possible design option for the zero is two horizontal lines), but for completeness it is good to have the full characters set available in fonts like this. Also the readability of fractional figures is very much dependent on the context, the shape and size of the pixels. It is up to the designer to decide if usage is appropriate in a given situation.</p>

<img src="image43.png">

<p>Both Prop Single and Prop Double include the OT-feature tnum (table numbers), which will force the figures (and some related characters like valuta, period, and comma) to a fixed width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image44.png">

<h4>Figures in Double</h4>

<p>As the Double does not have a Condensed OT-feature, there is only four sets of figures.</p>

<p>Mono Double figures on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels.</p>

<img src="image45.png">

<p>Mono Double figures width extended height on fixed spacing width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Extended capitals).</p>

<img src="image46.png">

<p>Mono Double small-cap table figures on fixed width of 6 pixels (using the OT-Feature Lowercase to smallcaps).</p>

<img src="image47.png">

<p>Prop Double with OT-Feature Fraction enabled on proportional width.</p>

<img src="image48.png">

<p>In all variant styles there are alternate slashed zeros available as OT-Feature zero.</p>

<img src="image49.png">

<h4>Matrix</h4>

<p>In case the full set of pixels is need (e.g. as a background layer with LED’s that are on/off), there are several matrices available when the OT feature Ligature is turned on. The availability of the matrix depends on the variant. In the illustration respectively are shown /matrix57, /matrix58, /matrix68, /matrix610. Also the TYPETR logo is available /typetr.</p>

<h3>OpenType Features</h3>

<p>Not all OpenType Features are available in every Bitcount variant. See the Reference for more details, specific per style.</p>

Biryani (बिरयानी) is a libre font development project. 
Its fonts are designed in a monolinear, geometric sans serif style. 
Like several early geometric sans typefaces from the last century, Biryani’s characters have a strong flavor to them; they are more wonky than sterile. 
Biryani’s fonts are indeed meant for text, just not necessarily for very long, immersive reading-length passages. 
The letterforms are a bit too “display” for that. 
</p>

<p>
Currently, the Biryani fonts support the Latin and Devangari scripts, meaning that Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali may be set with the fonts, in addition to most Western and Central European languages.
</p>

<p>
The Biryani project is led by Dan Reynolds, a type designer based in Berlin, Germany.

<p>Bigshot One is a contemporary Didone. The design plays within its systematic features and likes to be cheeky. Bigshot One also likes to show-off and prefers big display sizes.</p><p>The Bigelow Rules typeface is an odd hybrid from numerous inspirations.
Imagine Times Roman feels the squeeze, marries a Didone, and gives birth
to something with retro appeal and bounce with some eclectic glyph oddities 
thrown in for spunk. That is Bigelow Rules.</p>

Beth Ellen™ font is a joyful handwritten font created by Rob Jelinski (Art Direction & Design) and Alyson Fraser Diaz (Typography & Functionality) in 2018. 
The typeface was crafted after the penmanship of Rob's mom, Beth Ellen Jelinski who passed away from cancer on March 5th, 2017.
</p>
<p>
Upon it's formal release Jelinski stated, 
“The purpose of this typeface is to give, so it is totally free to use for personal or commercial projects under the SIL Open Font License. 
My single request is that you help the legacy of Beth Ellen live on by sending a short note to someone you love each time the font is used.
Tell them you love them, encourage them to be their best, or send them a scripture.
This is the way Beth Ellen lived her life, writing notes to share love and faith.”

Besley is a antique slab serif inspired by Robert Besley's Clarendon.
It features a full range of weights and matching italics, making it subtle for a variety of uses. A slight rounding of the corners gives a subtle warmth, and OpenType features such as ligatures and contextual substitutions perfect the finer details. It was made with love and will continue to improve with your support. </p>

<p>Berkshire Swash is an alluring semi-sweet typestyle with a bold yet feminine flair to it.</p> <p>Designed by Astigmatic (AOETI). To contribute to the project contact <a href="mailto:astigma@astigmatic.com">Brian J. Bonislawsky</a>.</p><p>
Bentham is inspired by the lettering of nineteenth-century maps, gravestones and the maker’s plates of cast-iron machinery. 
It is characterized by expressive, flowing, and bulging curves, mannered awkwardness, and the bobbles on the terminals of its characters. 
The ‘modern face’ type genre is the typographical equivalent, and it can be found in books printed throughout the nineteenth century. 
This genre survived in educational textbooks produced throughout the twentieth century, and is preserved in computer science as the style which Donald Knuth adopted for his <a href="http://www.tug.org/">T<sub>E</sub>X typesetting system</a>.
</p>
<p>
Bentham is a half-way design; 
true neither to the type produced during the nineteenth century, nor to the letterforms of cartographers, stonecutters, or engravers. 
Really it is an examination of the characteristics that these letters share, colored by Ben's approach to type drawing. 
</p>
<p>
    Benne is a Kannada text font developed by John Harrington.
    The style and weights are designed to harmonise with EB Garamond, originally designed by Georg Duffner.
</p>

<p>To contribute, see <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/Benne">github.com/googlefonts/Benne</a>.</p><p>The design of BenchNine is loosely based on the look of the ink spreads and
bleeds characteristic of traditional or vernacular woodcut type. The design
takes a mash-up of a number of old Stephenson Blake designs and rounds the
corners a little. In theory the face should work well for headlines that want
to stand out just a little from the crowd.</p><p>Bellota is an ornamented, low contrast sans-serif with text and swash alternates. It’s just cute enough!</p>

<p>It comes in two variations: Normal and Text. Each of these comes in three weights (Light/Regular/Bold) and Italics. There are stylistic alternates (for swash and non-ornamented characters) and ligatures available through OpenType features. Stylistic Set 1: Text, Stylistic Set 2: Swash caps.</p>

Baskervville is a revival of Jacob’s revival of Baskerville’s typeface. It was distributed by the Berger-Levrault Foundry from 1815. The font Jacob produced was sold as a “Caractères dans le genre Baskerwille” i.e “Baskerwille alike fonts” — with a w instead of a v. The particularity of Jacob’s Baskerwille is that the roman is very close to Baskerville’s typefaces while the italic is closer to Didot’s typefaces. The ANRT workshop that took place for five days aimed to digitize Jacob’s font in order to show his work which moves from transitional to modern styles. The typeface was then developped and engineered by Rosalie Wagner.
</p>
<p>
Baskervville was designed by the ANRT students from 2017 (Alexis Faudot, Rémi Forte, Morgane Pierson, Rafael Ribas, TanguyVanlaeys and Rosalie Wagner), under the direction of Charles Mazé and Thomas Huot-Marchand. 
<p>
In 2025, a bold weight designed by Thomas Huot-Marchand was added. Rosalie Wagner fixed some kerning and glyphset issues and improved the font's outlines for a better rendering on screen.

<h3>from Baskerville to Baskerwille to Baskervville</h4>
<img src="baskervville.png" />
<p>
In 1779, Sarah Eaves manages to sell Baskerville’s punches and supplies to Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais. Beaumarchais places his new printing house —<em>Société Littéraire Typographique</em>— in Kehl, Germany (6 kilometers away from Strasbourg, France) and gives Jean François Letellier the post of director. Letellier is in charge of supervising the negotiations of the sale and the transfer of the material from Birmingham to Kehl. Given the complexity of this work, Letellier hires a former Baskerville employee, presumably John Handy who had work with Baskerville for a long time, “to check, inspect, and put right if necessary all the punches used by Baskerville”. But this employee being too old to leave England, Letellier decides to send an employee of <em>Société Littéraire Typographique</em>, named Claude Jacob, to Birmingham to carry out this work.
</p>
<p>
<b>1784.</b> Soon after his return from Birmingham, Jacob has an argument with his employer (probably Letellier) and leaves Kehl with another employee of the <em>Société Littéraire Typographique</em>, Henri Rolland, to settle in Strasbourg. Together they make a request to the Magistrat of Strasbourg for the creation of a typefoundry, called <em>Société Typographique de Strasbourg</em>. At this time, there is no other type foundry in Strasbourg.
</p>
<p>
<b>1784-85.</b> A first type specimen is printed: <em>Épreuves des caracteres de la société typographique de Strasbourg; Par Jacob élève de Baskerville</em>. It is the first appearance of Jacob’s typeface based on Baskerville’s design, in 3 sizes. Jacob & Rolland are not totally honest here stating that Jacob had been “a pupil of Baskerville” (Jacob went to Birmingham 7 years after the death of Baskerville).
</p>
<p>
<b>1786.</b> Rolland & Jacob want to diversify their activity, and are given the permission to print, in addition to the engraving activity. Apparently, printing in Strasbourg at the time was not something easy, as 5 other printers were already in business, protecting their territory. Rolland went to Paris to present their typefaces to the King, and they obtained the title of “imprimeur du Roi” in 1789. It was apparently too much for the other printers in Strasbourg, and they started
a lawsuit against Rolland & Jacob.
</p>
<p>
<b>1788-89.</b> Despite these complications, a new type specimen is printed: <em>Épreuves des caractères de Rolland et Jacob</em>, à Strasbourg, including Jacob’s typeface now available in 6 sizes (Great Primer ou Gros Romain, English ou Saint-Augustin, Small-Pica ou Cicero, Long Primer ou Petit Romain, Parangon Petit oeil, Gros-Texte Petit oeil) all in roman and italic, among a few other typefaces, Vignettes and Filets. In 1789 however, Rolland & Jacob are ending their collaboration after a “disagreement”. In 1790, one of the five printers of Strasbourg, François-Xavier Levrault, took the opportunity to create a new partnership with Claude Jacob and a lawyer named Michel Thomassin, in order to continue to produce typefaces. A contract signed in January 12th and February 9th 1990 by Thomassin, Jacob, and Nicolas Levrault —the eldest of the Levrault family— states that the association would last 12 years, that Jacob would work for nobody else but the foundry, and that he would create all kind of typefaces with a minimum of one font per year. The new punches and matrices would belong to the association, and the association would go by the name of <em>Société typographique Levrault</em>. The story of the printers Levrault is also a very long one, beginning as early as 1676. In fact, Levrault’s printing activities have now stopped but the group still exists today as Berger- Levrault. They now produce softwares. Back in 1790, the new <em>Société typographique</em> operated as an annex of the Levrault printing house. Its publications indicated that the text was typesetted “Avec les caractères de Jacob”. Jacob had to produce these so-called “caractères de Jacob” on behalf of Levrault, but also to be sold to other printers in Strasbourg, in Alsace, in Lorraine, in Avignon, but also in Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. Levrault might have shut down the <em>Société typographique</em> between 1795 and 1800, and definitively integrated the type foundry to his printing facility. 
</p>
<p>
<b>1800.</b> A new type specimen is printed: <em>Épreuves des caractères de la fonderie des Frères Levrault</em>, in Strasbourg, and showing the “Caractères dans le genre de Baskerwille”. Jacob must have stopped working for Levrault earlier than in 1802 —he signed a 12-years contract in 1790—, as his name disappears. But the original source of his typeface, Baskerville, finally reappears, although spelled with a w instead of a v. We lose track of Claude Jacob at this point, but his design is preserved by Levrault.
</p>
<p>
<b>1815.</b> The last known specimen printed by Levrault, <em>Épreuves de la fonderie de François Georges Levrault, à Strasbourg, 1815</em> is still selling Jacob’s “Caractères dans le genre de Baskerwille”. In 1871, after the end of the Franco-Prussian War, Strasbourg is part of Imperial Germany and the Levrault decide to move to Nancy. Five years later, in 1876, a fire destroys the printing facility, and they have to build a new one from scratch. But despite all these difficulties, Jacob’s typeface survived and one finally finds it again in 1878, in a publication telling the long story of the Levrault, entitled <em>Notice historique de l’Imprimerie Berger-Levrault & Cie</em>, typesetted in “caractères genre Baskerwille (propriété de la Maison)”, as mentioned in the imprint.

The typeface was then developed and engineered by Rosalie Wagner.
</p>
<p>
Baskervville was designed by the ANRT students from 2017 (Alexis Faudot, Rémi Forte, Morgane Pierson, Rafael Ribas, Tanguy Vanlaeys and Rosalie Wagner), under the direction of Charles Mazé and Thomas Huot-Marchand. 
<p>
In 2025, a bold weight designed by Thomas Huot-Marchand was added. Rosalie Wagner fixed some kerning and glyphset issues and improved the font's outlines for a better rendering on screen.

<h3>from Baskerville to Baskerwille to Baskervville</h3>
<img src="baskervville.png" />
<p>
In 1779, Sarah Eaves manages to sell Baskerville’s punches and supplies to Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais. Beaumarchais places his new printing house —<em>Société Littéraire Typographique</em>— in Kehl, Germany (6 kilometers away from Strasbourg, France) and gives Jean François Letellier the post of director. Letellier is in charge of supervising the negotiations of the sale and the transfer of the material from Birmingham to Kehl. Given the complexity of this work, Letellier hires a former Baskerville employee, presumably John Handy who had worked with Baskerville for a long time, “to check, inspect, and put right if necessary all the punches used by Baskerville”. But this employee being too old to leave England, Letellier decides to send an employee of <em>Société Littéraire Typographique</em>, named Claude Jacob, to Birmingham to carry out this work.
</p>
<p>
<b>1784.</b> Soon after his return from Birmingham, Jacob has an argument with his employer (probably Letellier) and leaves Kehl with another employee of the <em>Société Littéraire Typographique</em>, Henri Rolland, to settle in Strasbourg. Together they make a request to the Magistrat of Strasbourg for the creation of a typefoundry, called <em>Société Typographique de Strasbourg</em>. At this time, there is no other type foundry in Strasbourg.
</p>
<p>
<b>1784-85.</b> A first type specimen is printed: <em>Épreuves des caractères de la société typographique de Strasbourg; Par Jacob élève de Baskerville</em>. It is the first appearance of Jacob’s typeface based on Baskerville’s design, in 3 sizes. Jacob & Rolland are not totally honest here stating that Jacob had been “a pupil of Baskerville” (Jacob went to Birmingham 7 years after the death of Baskerville).
</p>
<p>
<b>1786.</b> Rolland & Jacob want to diversify their activity, and are given the permission to print, in addition to the engraving activity. Apparently, printing in Strasbourg at the time was not something easy, as 5 other printers were already in business, protecting their territory. Rolland went to Paris to present their typefaces to the King, and they obtained the title of “imprimeur du Roi” in 1789. It was apparently too much for the other printers in Strasbourg, and they started
a lawsuit against Rolland & Jacob.
</p>
<p>
<b>1788-89.</b> Despite these complications, a new type specimen is printed: <em>Épreuves des caractères de Rolland et Jacob</em>, à Strasbourg, including Jacob’s typeface now available in 6 sizes (Great Primer ou Gros Romain, English ou Saint-Augustin, Small-Pica ou Cicero, Long Primer ou Petit Romain, Parangon Petit oeil, Gros-Texte Petit oeil) all in roman and italic, among a few other typefaces, Vignettes and Filets. In 1789 however, Rolland & Jacob are ending their collaboration after a “disagreement”. In 1790, one of the five printers of Strasbourg, François-Xavier Levrault, took the opportunity to create a new partnership with Claude Jacob and a lawyer named Michel Thomassin, in order to continue to produce typefaces. A contract signed in January 12th and February 9th 1990 by Thomassin, Jacob, and Nicolas Levrault —the eldest of the Levrault family— states that the association would last 12 years, that Jacob would work for nobody else but the foundry, and that he would create all kinds of typefaces with a minimum of one font per year. The new punches and matrices would belong to the association, and the association would go by the name of <em>Société typographique Levrault</em>. The story of the printers Levrault is also a very long one, beginning as early as 1676. In fact, Levrault’s printing activities have now stopped but the group still exists today as Berger- Levrault. They now produce software. Back in 1790, the new <em>Société typographique</em> operated as an annex of the Levrault printing house. Its publications indicated that the text was typeset “Avec les caractères de Jacob”. Jacob had to produce these so-called “caractères de Jacob” on behalf of Levrault, but also to be sold to other printers in Strasbourg, in Alsace, in Lorraine, in Avignon, but also in Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. Levrault might have shut down the <em>Société typographique</em> between 1795 and 1800, and definitively integrated the type foundry to his printing facility. 
</p>
<p>
<b>1800.</b> A new type specimen is printed: <em>Épreuves des caractères de la fonderie des Frères Levrault</em>, in Strasbourg, and showing the “Caractères dans le genre de Baskerwille”. Jacob must have stopped working for Levrault earlier than in 1802 —he signed a 12-years contract in 1790—, as his name disappears. But the original source of his typeface, Baskerville, finally reappears, although spelled with a w instead of a v. We lose track of Claude Jacob at this point, but his design is preserved by Levrault.
</p>
<p>
<b>1815.</b> The last known specimen printed by Levrault, <em>Épreuves de la fonderie de François Georges Levrault, à Strasbourg, 1815</em> is still selling Jacob’s “Caractères dans le genre de Baskerwille”. In 1871, after the end of the Franco-Prussian War, Strasbourg is part of Imperial Germany and the Levrault decide to move to Nancy. Five years later, in 1876, a fire destroys the printing facility, and they have to build a new one from scratch. But despite all these difficulties, Jacob’s typeface survived and one finally finds it again in 1878, in a publication telling the long story of the Levrault, entitled <em>Notice historique de l’Imprimerie Berger-Levrault & Cie</em>, typesetted in “caractères genre Baskerwille (propriété de la Maison)”, as mentioned in the imprint.

<p>Balthazar is a contemporary "Copperplate Gothic like" serif typeface inspired by the kind of typefaces used by many bistros and cafes in New York City and Paris. Unusually this type includes lowercase letters. The high x-height gives the text a compact look, true to the original Cooperplate Gothic design. The general form is less condensed. It has diagonal stress, and a soft variation in contrast to improve legibility. It is bolder than normal for better rasterization on screen. The typeface works smoothly at text sizes with its delicate serifs, which gives a crisp effect on the screen. At larger sizes it shows a strong personality with the combination of serif details and the modulation of its strokes. It is useful for both short text and headlines, but it is also comfortable for reading on screen.</p> <p>Designed by Dario Muhafara for <a href="http://www.tipo.net.ar">tipo foundry</a>.</p><p>Balsamiq Sans is the handwritten font created for the Balsamiq Wireframes and has been in use since version 2.1.</p>
<p>The font contains 942 glyphs in 2 weights with italics/obliques, and includes the basic and extended latin character set, Cyrillic, Basic Symbols and Dingbats, Math and Technical Symbols, and punctuation</p>

    The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word.
    This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or
    copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the
    renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.
</p>
<p>
    The Baloo 2 project consists of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=baloo">ten font families</a> with unique
    local names for each of the nine Indic scripts plus Arabic (Baloo Bhaijaan 2). Each family supports one
    Indic/Arabic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.
</p>
<p>
    It took a team of committed type designers to rear Baloo and raise it to be the typeface we love. The Gurmukhi is
    designed by Shuchita Grover; Bangla by Noopur Datye and Sulekha Rajkumar; Odia by Yesha Goshar, Manish Minz, and
    Shuchita Grover; Gujarati by Noopur Datye and Supriya Tembe; Kannada by Divya Kowshik and Shuchita Grover; Telugu by
    Maithili Shingre and Omkar Shende; Malayalam by Maithili Shingre and Unnati Kotecha; and Tamil by Aadarsh Rajan.
    Baloo Devanagari and Latin are collaboratively designed by Ek Type. Font engineering and type design assistance by

It’s designed to do more than just look good; it’s here to create an impact, to grab attention, and to express a sense of personality that’s both grounded and forward-thinking.</p>
<p>This is the font for creators who want to make a statement, who want every letter to have meaning and every word to stand out. Badeen Display is about embodying a vibrant character in a way that’s contemporary, yet unmistakably rooted in culture. It’s a tool to bring your brand to life, to speak with authenticity and clarity, and to capture the spirit of something timeless yet completely new. When you choose Badeen Display, you’re not just choosing a font—you’re making a creative decision to stand out, to resonate, and to inspire.</p>

B612 is an highly legible open source font family, designed and tested to be used on aircraft cockpit screens. 
Its design makes it particularly suitable for degraded contexts (ensuring legibility and readability of data), with a positive effect on reducing visual fatigue and cognitive load. 
Particular attention was given to the uniformity of the typeface, whether being used for isolated terms, reading information on a map, mixing capital letters and numbers, waypoint lists, long or abbreviated texts, specific terms and data in the aeronautical field.
</p>
<p>
In 2010, Airbus initiated a research collaboration with ENAC and Université de Toulouse III on a prospective study to define and validate an “Aeronautical Font”: the challenge was to improve the display of textual data information on all cockpit screens, concerning more specifically legibility, readability and reading comfort, and to enhance the overall cockpit consistency. 
The typographical research was conducted through iterations from experimentation to design. 
Two years later, Airbus came to Intactile DESIGN in order to design and develop the eight variants of the font. 
Baptized B612 in reference to the imaginary asteroid of the aviator Antoine de Saint‑Exupéry, the font has been optimised following a calligraphic approach, in order to preserve the readable qualities of humanist typefaces like réales and incises, but also the technical and functional image of sans serif or bitmap.
</p>
<p>
B612 is a two-weight font family including roman and italic styles but also a monospaced variation, B612 Mono.

In 2017, Airbus agreed to publish the font with an open source license (Eclipse Public License) within the <a href="https://www.polarsys.org/projects/polarsys" target="_blank">Polarsys project</a>, an industry-oriented project hosted by the Eclipse foundation.

<p>Azeret Mono is a monospaced typeface with a mono-linear character. The story of the typeface began with a draft that was driven by an exploration of OCR fonts, past and futuristic operating systems, various interfaces and the nineties. The final result is more based on a desire to achieve an appearance of the typeface that could serve in operating systems. Thus the overall character is a conjunction of everything described with details that evoke a specific personality.</p>

<p>Average Sans has the color, structure and proportions of its serif sister
family, <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Average">Average</a>,
which it complements harmoniously. The neutrality of the forms create a nice

<p>To contribute to the project contact 
<a href="mailto:edu@tipo.net.ar">Eduardo Tunni</a>.</p><p>Average is a typeface that emerged from a long process of research into
text typeface families from various different historical periods, both
classical and contemporary. The idea was to design an average font for use in
text, through a lengthy process of shape measurement and data gathering in
spreadsheets. This resulted in a series of parameters which could be used by a
designer to determine the proportions, color, spacing and other attributes of
a typeface. Once the parameters were defined and best values were selected,
the forms for the Average Regular typeface were drawn.</p>

<p>In september 2022, Average has been updated to provide a larger glyphset and therefore greater language support.</p>

<p>A sans sister family, 
<a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Average+Sans">Average Sans</a>,

The friendly personality is based on humanist calligraphy, and has an organic look and feel while preserving the traditional construction of Roman type. 
It all started with a desire to learn more about the origin of strokes in human handwriting. 
It is designed to reflect a trace of writing tools and convey its inspiration. 
The family consists of 6 weights that can be used in headlines or body text.
</p>
<p>
The outer curves contrast with the angled inner counter shapes, which distributes feelings of strength and softness at the same time. 
Athiti can be used with a mixture of formal and informal content, for example in educational work.
</p>
<p>
A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, or ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
A specific approach has been taken for dealing with thick and thin strokes in the Thai design. 
Other type designers may consider this font as an example when developing new fonts. 
</p>
<p>
Informal loopless Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to the formal looped style, and this allows type designers to extend loopless families to very black weights.
Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.
Also, in this case, ink trapping is required when connecting two specific strokes of each glyph, and it has to be done carefully, as it has been in Athiti.
</p>
<p>
The Athiti project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

    Asset was inspired by the engraved letters found on United States dollar bills. Asset belongs to the "fat face"
    category because it is so bold or heavy. It is also a high contrast design and very extended or wide. Although it is
    legible at medium sizes it will shine most when used large where both its restraint and passion can be seen. This
    font was made specifically to be used on the web, but will work well in print.

Asar is an original Devanagari and Latin typeface that is based on an expanding brush stroke following a heart line. 
The design is meant to work well with long texts while maintaining a certain charm at large sizes.
Asar is partially derived from Pria Ravichadran's <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Palanquin">Palanquin</a>, starting by interpreting that design's overall proportions and heart lines and glyph set and OpenType features.
</p>

<p>
The design arrives at its own identity by adjusting for the density of certain brush strokes, that dictate wider spacing and new forms.
The brush used is the Expand Path feature of Fontlab Studio 5, using a width of 93, an angle of -55, and a roundness of 35.
In general the letters are designed so as to not require further adjustment, but where this is not satisfying then manual adjustments are made.

Arvo is a geometric slab-serif typeface family suited for screen and print. 
The family includes 4 cuts: Roman, Italic, Roman Bold, Bold Italic. 
It is a libre font, first published in Google Fonts. 
The flavour of the font is rather mixed. 
It's monolinear-ish, but has a tiny bit of contrast (which increases the legibility a little in Mac OS X.)
</p>

<p>
The name Arvo is a typical Estonian man's name, but is not widely used today. 
In the Finnish language, Arvo means "number, value, worth." Considering how much programming is involved in hinting, all these meanings are true.
</p>

<p>
In December 2013 Arvo 2.0.1 was released, with support for languages that use the Cyrillic script, the latin script is expanded to Adobe's  Glyph List 3, and many truetype hints are improved especially for in smaller sizes (regular cuts start now from 9ppem). 
Also added PANOSE classification numbers, cleaned up character palette order, and many more smaller bug fixes were made.
</p>

<p>
<b>Updated August 2015:</b> Bold and Bold Italic styles were updated to allow document embedding.
</p>

<p>
Arvo – это брусковый шрифт из семейства геометрических шрифтов с прямоугольными засечками. 
Данный шрифт создан для использования на экранах, а также в печатном виде (офсетная печать и т.д). 
Шрифт состоит из четырёх начертании: обычный, курсив, жирный и жирный курсив.Arvo распространяется на основании лицензии OFL. 
Благодаря которой любой пользователь может скачать/загрузить данное семейство шрифтов и пользоваться ими по своему усмотрению (смотри подробнее <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL">scripts.sil.org/OFL</a>). 
Для улучения читаемости на экранах, шрифт имеет детальное оптимирование Truetype (хинтинг), что в системах Windows и Linux предоставляет возможность набора мелкого шрифта, не теряя при этом качества читаемости.

    A display font with soft edges and calligraphic feel is the main inspiration for Arima project.
</p>
<p>
    It has a low contrast to allow good rendering on screen.
    Legibility is always a central concern, but the design has a lot of personality to be recognizable as a display font
    to be used in headlines, brand names, and similar uses on the web.
    The primary goal was to create a design that will prove popular because it resonates with both casual and
    professional designers, and without ever lowering the quality of the design.
    Each font in the family was extensively tested on low resolution phones and refined to work well as a web font in
    the mobile era.
    From the very first round of design testing, each font was hinted with ttfautohint and refined for Windows users.

<p> Anek, as the meaning of the word suggests, is an exercise in multiplicity — multiple scripts designed in multiple
    weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s
    letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.
</p>

<p> Its expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep
    structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter
    yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and
    tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that
    magnetic word-mark.</p>

<p> Anek comes in <a href="/?query=Anek">ten scripts</a>: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi,
    Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively
    decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic
    culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers. </p>

Andika is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of beginning readers. 
The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms that will not be readily confused with one another.
</p>
<p>
Starting with an initial draft of a basic lowercase Latin alphabet by Victor Gaultney, Annie Olsen refined the design and added over 4,700 glyphs, including a complete extended Cyrillic set.
</p>
<p>
A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching people to read. 
Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than those of most serif fonts. 
For years, literacy workers have had to make do with fonts that were not really suitable for beginning readers and writers. 
In some cases, literacy specialists have had to tediously assemble letters from a variety of fonts in order to get all of the characters they need for their particular language project, resulting in confusing and unattractive publications. 
Andika addresses those issues.
</p>
<p>
The font has been upgraded in May 2022. This upgrade gives additional weight styles and expands the glyphset to support full Latin and Cyrillic characters sets. Rendering is also much improved.

    UNAL Ancízar is a highly versatile and legible typeface family, initially designed in 2014 to strengthen the
    institutional image of Universidad Nacional de Colombia, the country's largest public university. This typeface was
    initially designed by Professor César Puertas (Faculty of Arts, Bogotá Campus), Viviana Monsalve, and Julián
    Moncada, within the framework of a project led by Professor Jaime Franky Rodríguez (Director of the Communications &
    Media Unity - UNIMEDIOS), Martha Lucía Chaves Muñoz (Head of the Digital Media Office), and María Teresa Naranjo
    Castillo (Institutional Image Coordinator). In 2024, the University released the typeface family under the
    leadership of Professor Jaime Rodolfo Ramírez Rodríguez (director of UNIMEDIOS), to transcend the institution and
    constitute a contribution from UNAL to humanity.
</p>
<p>
    Naturally diverse, the UNAL Ancízar type family is designed for daily use in almost any condition. All fonts share a
    common structure that enhances both readability and identity, while a broad range of weights ensures adaptability
    for various needs. UNAL Ancízar is not only optimized for challenging print environments—its streamlined curves also
    perform exceptionally well on digital screens, giving text a unique personality that helps distinguish the
    university from others.
</p>
<p>
    The UNAL Ancízar type family is divided into two groups: Serif and Sans Serif, enhancing its versatility and
    adaptability to various applications. The Serif fonts are designed for long texts, such as essays and articles,
    while the Sans Serif variants excel in signage and headlines, ensuring optimal performance in shorter texts. Its
    robust typographic repertoire—including diacritics, small caps, and uppercase and lowercase numerals—ensures broad
    functionality.
</p>
<p>
    With nine weights, Ancízar offers a diverse range of styles, making it easier to select the right variant for each
    context. Its extensive character set (1,043 per font) supports Western Latin, monotonic Greek, and the International
    Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Beyond meeting institutional requirements, this typographic richness allows the university
    community to explore and express its creativity with greater freedom.
</p>
<p>
    Since 2014, several individuals have played a key role in the development and refinement of this type family. We
    extend our gratitude to Julián Prieto Velandia, José Castro Garnica, Mariel Hernández Camino, Felipe Aragón Rubio,
    Sara Alarcón Quinche, Raúl Aponte, Jhon García and to the Digital Media Office (Martha Lucía Chaves Muñoz, María
    Teresa Naranjo Castillo, Giovanni Romero Pérez, Alejandro Díaz Vecchio and Aldemar Hernández Torres) for their

Amita is the Indian Feminine form of Amit.
Amita is a Latin and Devanagari typeface derived from 
<a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Redressed">Redressed</a> and Modular Infotech Devanagari 2310 and 1228.
The Latin is a script type designed by Brian Bonislawsky which blends script and italic letterforms together in an upright non-connecting style. 
Open spacing and stylish letterforms lend themselves to titling, but also to clean legibility at smaller sizes as body copy.
The Devanagari is a traditionally calligraphic style.
The combination was designed by Eduardo Tunni.
</p>

    Amiri is a revival of the beautiful typeface pioneered in early 20th century by
    Bulaq Press in Cairo, also known as Amiria Press, after which the font is
    named.
</p>

<p>    
    The uniqueness of this typeface comes from its superb balance between the
    beauty of Naskh calligraphy on one hand, the constraints and requirements of
    elegant typography on the other. Also, it is one of the few metal typefaces
    that were used in typesetting the Koran, making it a good source for a digital
    typeface to be used in typesetting Koranic verses.
</p>

<p>    
    Amiri project aims at the revival of the aesthetics and traditions of Arabic
    typesetting, and adapting it to the era of digital typesetting, in a publicly
    available form.

</p><p>Amethysta was designed by Konstantin Vinogradov with the purpose of printing on low quality paper in mind. This is why it has such minimalistic wedge serifs and terminals. It builds the impression of a simple and strong text typeface. In terms of proportions it is closely related to the transitional serif group.</p> <p>Amethysta is suitable for small to medium sizes, while some details will be noticeable at larger sizes. It also will work well in print.</p><p>
Amatic SC (Small Caps) is a simple but effective hand drawn webfont.

given the opportunity in huge sizes. The main challenge was to make compatible
dialectic elements, especially balancing legibility and formal identity.

</p><p>Alkalami is the local word for the Arabic "qalam", a type of sharpened stick used for writing on wooden boards in the Kano region of Nigeria and in Niger, and what gives the style its distinct appearance. The baseline stroke is very thick and solid. The ascenders and other vertical strokes including the teeth are very narrow when compared to the baseline. A generous line height is necessary to allow for deep swashes and descenders, and the overall look of the page is a very black, solid rectangle. Diacritics are much smaller in scale, with very little distance from the main letters.</p>

 Alatsi is an original typeface designed by Spyros Zevelakis.
</p>
<p>
 It is a semicondensed geometric sans design which feels familiar, calm, trustable and contemporary.
 It is a little lighthearted or casual in feeling as well.
 The contemporary feeling comes from the treatment of the terminals and the cheekily pointed V A W.
 The calmness from the modest x height.
</p>
<p>
 Alatsi offers a wide range of figures which include oldstyle figures, numerators, denominators and fractions.
 It also offers case sensitive forms.

    Agu Display is a distinctive typeface inspired by Nsibidi, an ancient graphic communication system from Nigeria and Cameroon's Cross River region. Used by the Ejagham, Ibibio, Efik, and Igbo peoples, Nsibidi's pictograms are deeply rooted in cultural storytelling and expression.
</p>
<p>
    Today, Nsibidi's symbols have found widespread use in modern design, from digital platforms like Marvel's "Black Panther" to print media, including fabric patterns and tattoos. Its pictographic nature allows for diverse creative applications, merging ancient art with contemporary design.
</p>
<p>
    Agu Display serves as a bridge between historical symbolism and modern typography. It's not just a font but a tool for cultural preservation, enabling designers to infuse their work with African heritage's depth and richness. This typeface celebrates tradition while fostering innovative expression, linking ancient communication with today's design needs.

    give an edge to your typography.

Adobe Blank is a special-purpose OpenType font that is based on the Adobe-Identity-0 ROS. 
(ROS stands for /Registry, /Ordering, and /Supplement, and refers to the /CIDSystemInfo dictionary entries that define the glyph set name for CID-based character collections.) 
The Adobe-Identity-0 ROS is a special-purpose character collection whose use is not tied to a specific language, and Adobe Blank 2 is a special-purpose OpenType font that is intended to render all Unicode code points using non-spacing and non-marking glyphs, thus the reason why the Adobe-Identity-0 ROS was chosen as the basis for this OpenType font.
</p>
<p>
Adobe Blank maps 1,111,998 Unicode code points to 2,048 non-spacing and non-marking glyphs (CIDs 1 through 2048). 
The 2,048 High and Low Surrogates (U+D800 through U+DFFF), the two noncharacters in the BMP and in each of the 16 Supplementary Planes (FFFE and FFFF), and the 32 noncharacters in the range U+FDD0 through U+FDEF are explicitly and intentionally excluded. 
As a fully-functional OpenType font, the following 10 'sfnt' tables are included in an OTF format version of the font: CFF, DSIG, OS/2, cmap, head, hhea, hmtx, maxp, name, and post.
</p>
<p>
In addition to a functional OpenType/CFF font, Adobe provides a TrueType (TTF) version that is available here (with a slight modification to the PostScript Name in the 'name' table from 'AdobeBlank' to 'AdobeBlank-Regular'.)
</p>
<p>
The Adobe Blank project is led by Dr. Ken Lunde, a font engineer in the Adobe Type team based in San Jose, California.

<p>A diploma thesis project from the Aachen University of Applied Sciences at Karl-Friedrich (Kai) Oetzbach. The font originated in a course in type design. The idea was to learn through the creation of a typeface about writing as an information carrier. It was created entirely digitally, so the path to the current version is very rocky and winding.</p> <p>Actor has a strong x-height, which is why it always requires a fairly high line spacing. The digits of Actor are created as old style figures. The forms of 6 and 9 are more dynamic and more tense than usual. The 8 has significantly shifted interiors and the 7 is slightly curved to the left.</p><p>Acme is a condensed display typeface inspired by the visual language of classic cartoons and comics. It is designed to be used in headlines, and has a particular and groovy rhythm. The resulting texts are vivid but consistent, and its expressive characteristics work as well on screen as in print. The glyphs were each carefully designed, with top curve quality. It is well balanced, and carefully spaced by eye.</p> <p>Designed by Juan Pablo del Peral for <a href="https://www.huertatipografica.com">Huerta Tipográfica</a>.</p>

<p>Abril Fatface is part of a bigger type family system, Abril, which includes 18 styles for all Display and Text uses. The titling weights are a contemporary revamp of classic Didone styles, display both neutrality and strong presence on the page to attract reader attention with measured tension by its curves, good color and high contrast.</p> <p>Abril Fatface in particular is inspired by the heavy titling fonts used in advertising posters in 19th century Britain and France. The thin serifs and clean curves lend the typeface a refined touch that give any headline an elegant appearance. The Extended Latin character set supports over 50 languages, including those from Central and Northern Europe.</p> <p>Abril is designed by TypeTogether - Veronika Burian & José Scaglione. The additional weights of Abril can be seen at <a href="http://www.type-together.com/Abril">www.type-together.com/Abril</a></p><p>Aboreto is a display typeface based on early renaissance majuscule alphabet done by Luca della Robbia, a 15th century Florentine sculptor. The typeface is not a straightforward digitalization (it even couldn’t be as the early Latin alphabet didn’t include all the letters we use today) but more of a revival which keeps current needs and technologies in mind.</p>

<p>Aboreto has vertical stress, a feature more typical of later-century typefaces. Another uniqueness lies in the construction, because it is essentially a sans-serif typeface that has only occasional indication of serifs – either via the “hidden” serifs caused by stroke tapering or by slightly thickening the stroke endings.

Aboreto comes in one weight - a high contrast regular that is on the thinner side.</p>

Abhaya Libre is the unicode compliant, complete libre version of the most widely used Sinhala typeface ‘FM Abhaya’ and includes Sinhala and Latin support. 
Designed in 1996, ‘FM Abhaya’ is an interpretation of the Sinhala letterpress typefaces from 1960s.
The name ‘Abhaya’ is derived from the King Abhaya (474 BCE to 454 BCE) who reigned Sri Lanka from the ancient kingdom of Upatissa Nuwara. 
</p>
<p>
‘Abhaya Libre’ was completely redrawn from scratch based on FM Abhaya to comply with modern day usages in terms of web, tab and smaller sizes for smartphones. 
Available in 5 weights, Abhaya Libre enables designers to build sophisticated typographic layouts by using lighter weights for body text and heavier weights for headlines and subheadings. 
Each of these weights contains 925 glyphs that enables clean and precise rendering for Sinhala, Pali and Sanskrit texts. 
Compact ‘Da’ forms can be enabled by using stylistic sets. 
The Latin characters, that match the aesthetics of ‘Abhaya Libre Sinhala’, which was inspired by the style of the original Sinhala with an eminent contrast between distinctive strokes that go from thick to thin and was further modified to co-exist with the visual logics of Latin typefaces. 
The ductus references according to the lines of a Didone typeface add a touch of Sinhala form to certain terminations. 
Large counters have been added along with small ascenders and descenders for optimized screen viewing.
</p>
<p>
The project is led by <a href="http://mooniak.com/">Mooniak</a>, a small type foundry based in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pushpananda.ekanayaka">Pushpananda Ekanayake</a>.

This motif allows for a vast array of setting possibilities.</p> <p>Though intended for display, Syncopate does work well for limited text runs. The letter forms are a modern and stylish sans serif inspired by the many trendy sans serif typefaces that are so prevalent today. The lighter weight and wide body impart a certain level of elegance, while the unicase approach keeps the look lively and fresh.</p> <p>A true bold was added in April 2011.</p><p>
